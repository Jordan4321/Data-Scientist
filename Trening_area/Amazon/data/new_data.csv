0,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,I thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm. I think it is too small to read on it... not very comfortable as regular Kindle. Would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead.,3
1,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,This kindle is light and easy to use especially at the beach!!!,5
2,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,"Didnt know how much i'd use a kindle so went for the lower end. im happy with it, even if its a little dark",4
3,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,"I am 100 happy with my purchase. I caught it on sale at a really good price. I am normally a real book person, but I have a 1 year old who loves ripping up pages. The Kindle prevents that, it's extremely portable (it fits better in my purse than a giant book), and I have it loaded with lots of books. I finish one and start another, without having to go store. It serves all my needs. I picked this one over the Paperwhite because the price was unbeatable and the only difference that I could see was this one wasn't backlit. A simple book light from the Dollar tree solves that issue. This is my second Kindle (the first being the old Keyboard model, which I put down because I fell out of love with the keyboard. Lol) and it most likely won't be my last.",5
4,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,Solid entry level Kindle. Great for kids. Gifted for a kid of my friend and they love to use it to read more than their iPads. battery is good but higher model is a bit better.,5

6,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,"I ordered this for my daughter, as I have the black paperwhite, and I love it. I read quite a bit and the larger books were driving me crazy having to hold them up while laying down, or wanting to take a book on vacation and lugging around a thick paperback, with this I can throw it in my bag and read anywhere. Its light weight, easy to use, the battery life lasts for weeks, which makes it an all around awesome device. My daughter is in public school and they offer an online library for E-Readers, so she can now download books for free from school! You can also download your own public library app (if your county offers that) and read free from there as well. You can shop for e-books straight from the device through Amazon.com.",5

20,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,"I was looking for a kindle whitepaper. I saw online for $80. What a deal. I ordered it on line and picked it up in the store. I got it home and couldn't adjust the brightness. After a lengthy time with online customer service I called customer service. After 20 minuets with speaking to a female Elmer Fud that doesn't speak english well I figured I would just return it. Although it looks Identical to the $120 model, you can not adjust the brightness. That would have been good information before I bought it.",1
21,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,This is a nice bare-bones reading device. Easy to set up and use. My greatest issue is that it isn't back lit so it can't be used w/o a light on in the room. Returning it an purchasing a paperwhite instead.,4

29,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,"I like this e reader, but wish the screen were higher resolution. It requires decent light to look good, but it is easy on my eyes. The screen updates involve flashing the whole screen, which I noticed less over time. The advertised month long battery life is just standby time, it lasts much less if you are downloading and reading books.",4
30,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,My fianc√©e really enjoyes it! I would definitely recommend.,4

50,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,"This Kindle doesn't have a lighted screen like the pricier models but it has a higher dpi screen than the lower model.

52,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,"After the first one stopped working after only 3 weeks-best Buy replaced it with no fuss and it's going great. Small, lightweight (so fits in a purse/handbag) and with the anti-glare screen you can read in direct sunlight",4
53,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,"I bought this Kindle Paperwhite for my son to use at school, instead of his more expensive and delicate tablet. The display options make it adaptable for just about anyone, and is much easier on the eyes when reading for an extended period of time. Please keep in mind that this does not have a glowlight. The Kindle is durable, and although I bought a case for it, a case really isnt necessary if you are relatively careful with it. The most surprising thing about this has been the extra long battery life. My son is an avid reader, and noticed that he needs to charge his Kindle considerably less than when he uses his tablet.",5
54,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,"Great item, easy to use,would recommend to anybody want to use!",5
55,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,I bought this as a gift to my dad and he loves it. Well worth if you dont plan on reading in dark.,5

This latest version of the kindle is excellent. I am jealous of my daughter and now am thinking about upgrading from my older kindle. The touchscreen is responsive. If you like reading on the kindle, it is worth the update.",5
58,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,"This is a great way to read books on the go. There's no backlight, so reading in darker rooms may be hard. But it's affordable and portable and a great way to take all your books with you.",5
59,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,"I love the Kindle, it is a great product. It reduces eye strain so I enjoy reading on it. This is my second Kindle.",5
60,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,i bought this as a backup. I am currently using the same headphone.,4
61,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,"We got the Kindle for our daughter who accompanied us to try out the two Kindle models. We were willing to buy either one and we assumed she would want the more expensive one with the backlighting feature. But as she tried both, she gravitated with certainty toward the basic model. ""Why would U want to read in the dark?"" She said. As the weeks and months have gone by, she says she's completely happy with the basic Kindle, it's exactly what she wanted. Perfect.",5
62,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,"Good, able to read under bright sunlight conditions too",4
63,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,Very easy to handle. many books to choose from and very convenient,5
64,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,I purchased this product because I love to read and buying books got costly. With this product I can read all I want for 10.00 a month,5
65,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,it is smaller than i thought but it gets the job done.,5
66,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,"Love my new Kindle! I hadn't read in a while and hesitant of a kindle, easy to use, lightweight and convenient to pick up a book. great for outdoor reading. only downside is if you want to read in the dark has no back light. crisp clear text and easy to set up.",5
67,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,"Product is good, light. Amazing battery backup. I charge the Kindle one in 4 weeks. Great product for reasonable price. USB connection is easy, Books are easy to download. Overall, everyone must have Kindle with them and this is the best product/model to start with.Understandably, this is the beginner level model for people who never used Kindle before. Features like LED lights, White paper background are not available on this model. These features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in Dark without lights. But again, for this price you would not get any other good readers.If you are someone who reads in dark then I would suggest go for Higher Kindle models.",5
68,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,Kindle is the perfect E-reader. Easy to use and size is perfect to bring 'book' on the go.,5
69,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,Easy to use and it arrived exactly as described. Good beginner device for youngsters who want a device to read from.,4
70,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,Looking at the picture and seeing it was 8th generation I assumed it would be a great device. I had an original Kindle but I stopped using it because it wasn't backlit. I thought an 8th generation would be backlit and the picture makes it look backlit but it is not. After 25 minutes on the phone with Amazon trying to make it brighter the technician finally realized that 8th generation is not supported with backlights. I took it back to Target and purchased The Paperwhite which was more money but definitely worth it. The 8th generation one is smaller so I assumed that was the reason for the price difference. Target made the experience pleasant.,1
71,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,My fiance really enjoyes it! I would definitely recommend.,4
72,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,"For me, the Kindle Black was not a good fit for me. There are times I read at night in bed when my husband is sleeping. This model doesn't have a back light so I'm unable to read at night without turning on a light and waking up my husband.So I returned and went for a Kindle Fire.",3
73,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,"It is still the best device for buying books and reading them. However, go with kindle paperwhite if you read books in dark places.",5
74,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,Great product and service and the sales man r really nice.,5
75,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,"When you first turn on the kindle, the home screen does not make it easy to determine exactly how to open up and read a downloaded book.",4
76,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,"My wife loves it, replaces a Kindle from like 2003.",5
77,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,"It's small, light, and easy to read from. I just wish I would have spent the extra 30 bucks and got the paperwhite. The more i use this one the more I wish I had the option of a backlight. If you're on the fence as I was, go with the paperwhite! However if the backlight is not an issue, this device is great and I would recommend it.",4
78,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,This device is good for entry level reader only in daylight.Its doesnot support reading in dark. To read in dark you will have to purchase a light or cover case with light attached. I either case it will put a lot of strain in your eyes.,3
79,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,"I love my new Kindle. The size is perfect. It fits right in my purse. Easy to navigate and I love the touch screen. I am able to read outside without a glare. Only flaw is that it is not backlit, so in order to read in the dark I need a book light. I don't mind that so much, I just wish kindle would come out with a case for this Kindle with a built in book light like they did for the first generation Kindle.",4
80,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,it would not load my books proper. took a dozen tries erasing an dreregistering. screen too dark,2
81,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,"I bought this for my daughter. It is our 4th Kindle bought within the family. The touchscreen is great and my daughter loves it. In fact, those of us with older model Kindles are jealous.",5
82,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,"This is a pretty cool little device. Im able to download books through wireless and read them later at my convenience. Only drawback is I wish it had more storage. But for the price, it works good.",3
83,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,Exactly what I was looking for size wise and functional.,5
84,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,"As always, great job! Very easy to use and it's always with me. Only problem I have is the button on the bottom is touchy, but not really an issue. Keep up the good work",4
85,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,"I especially like the Amazon has a system to convert pdf to kindle format. Some of the things I read (journal articles) are in pdf format and I can email them to my kindle email and it shows up on my kindle with kindle format (larger text). You can find your kindel email at your account information. Only thing, I would have like a screen little larger.",4

87,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,"This is my eighth Kindle. Some others were either lost or screen-damaged. I bought it as a spare.

90,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,"I love my Kindle! I'm back to reading so much more often as I always have several books with me at all times! At first it surprised me that this version doesn't have a back light and you need a light to read, but I actually like it now as I don't get the eye strain like I do when using my phone.",4
91,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,"I love having real books, but these are great for travel and keeping your bookshelves lighter. I wish you could buy them with larger storage without having to buy the larger size pad. It also sucks that they are 4gig, but 1gig is taken up by the OS and advertising. Seriously? It reads PDFs and needs a 1 gig OS. Lame. The last thing I would change is being able to reverse the lettering so at night you could have white lettering and a black background, so it's less bright on the eyes.",3

122,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Love all my Echo products and this one is exceptional as well. Was able to look in my house while away. Waiting for more update for access to apps in the future.,5
123,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Little putsy so far, but there are continuous updates that I think will make this a great device to stay connected with family. Bought a second for my dad. Who knows, he might replace his land line someday if this gets better. I do think our original Echo is a bit better at responding, but I enjoy this one in the kitchen /aka hub of the house.",4
124,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","It's at its heart an echo, but having a screen on it, with 1000s of things to do with it make it a much easier recommendation over the simarly priced screenless echo plus",5
125,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Amazon - Echo Show is the best of all my Amazon products. I love the hands-free but able to see things on the screen.,5

128,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",The unit does a good job of playing music from Amazon music. It hears your voice very good although it gets confused at times when I tell it to turn on a particular lamp and I have to slowly pronunciate it. Like that the music shows the lyrics. Do need a family account on Amazon music to plan different music on different units in different rooms at the same time though.,5
129,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",It‚Äôs awesome being able to control the lighting and lots of other controls with this!,5
130,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","I‚Äôm a big echo fan, so this seemed like a no brainer. I like it a lot, but I‚Äôm disappointed about google pulling YouTube functionality. I also feel like the original echo speaker sounded a little better and listened better with kitchen related background noise.",4
131,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","I was jealous when our son showed us his Amazon Show and some of the things it was capable of doing. Since AOL eliminated Instant Messaging, my wife and I were less able to communicate because our offices are on separate floors. So we got two Shows and two Spots and now not only can intercom easily but use Alexa for music and many other things. We will probably start using some smart home devices which Alexa can also control. It's a fun device which seems to be getting better all the time.",5
132,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","We use this as a monitor for the amazon cloud camera! Works great we tell it to show us the camera ,and boom, there‚Äôs the video feed. Super easy to link our echo plus and the echo dot with the show!!",4

138,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Screen is really nice great for videos I would definetly recommend it,5
139,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","We bought the two-for deal as presents. My mother will have a learning curve, but since the other one is going to my son, he can teach her! Looks like a neat appliance, but want to see if it can do more than weather, music and turning off the lights...",4
140,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",By far my favorite Amazon product. I bought one for every bedroom in the home.,5
141,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Very fun to have music at the ready with a voice command. We use it with Amazon Unlimited which has nearly everything. Good to view recipes with Allrecipes, so we keep it in the kitchen for reference and musical ambience. The video is good too, it has youtube functionality. It would be nice to have regular tv though, but that is probably on the providers for now.. nice to have the photo background and lastly, to have lyrics on the screen when music is played!",5
142,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I was using the original Echo seldomly. Then I decided to get the Show... I use the Show a lot more. Was simple to set up and you can make calls with video. Great product,5
143,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","I have to say it was a little confusing and frustrating when i was not getting the verification code from amazon , i waited for 20 minutes then i requested another code, nothing... then a nother one... and still nothing , i started to set up the device at 8.30 am and by 11.20 am i was fed up with it.. i had to step away.... after about 5 hours we went shopping and at the mall i recieved about 4 codes from amazon ....",2
144,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",My dad uses this as a speaker for the tv ...and loves it. He does use it in the traditional Alexa way...but the speaker option he discovered is an added benefit.,5

150,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","It‚Äôs Alexa, but it has a screen, and it sounds pretty decent for a countertop device. My wife loves having it in the kitchen for recipes, weather music and fun!",5

154,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",We struggled with a surprise Christmas gift this year. The store sales rep suggested this and it was a hit!,5
155,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","The Echo Show is a game changer, it's amazing as are all the Echo's but with this one you can watch video's, or see who's at your door.

We play music every day on it. Every one in the family is enjoying it. Only dislike is that it doesn‚Äôt have the hub.,4

162,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Alexa may be new, but I would have thought some of the simple commands she would have been able to respond to already. For the amount Amazon charges, it should come with better instructions, including what specifically to download into one's device (iPhone, etc.) so as to make some apps ready to go. Amazon dropped the ball on this one.",3
163,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","I previously owned a Nucleus device which was similar to this device but was not a great device and had a lot of bugs and did not do much so I returned it. This device is a masterpiece! Not only is it tied into the Alexa Echo universe, it can be used as an intercom throughout your house with other Echos and also can be used to view things and even call people that have Echo directly. It is an amazing piece of hardware and Amazon should be proud of themselves for developing such a beautiful device!",5
164,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","I love the echo show it is in my kitchen and we use it almost daily to listen to music while we cook and also to find new recipes to try, my kids use it to help with homework, my whole family uses it with ease and everyone loves it.",5

170,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","I find myself saying to my phone, ""Alexa, play........."". I wish they made it for my car too.",5
171,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Love how the echo show integrates with smart house devices and cameras. I use it to view our cameras, listen to music, make phone calls/video calls and even as a recipe guide when cooking. I‚Äôve been very impressed!",5
172,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Not going to lie - we haven‚Äôt even opened it yet. Planning on getting it all setup tomorrow night. I did see it at the store though & it was incredible,4
173,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","I like having the screen and being able to see things like weather reports, etc. Still not using it to its full potential, but we have it controlling a couple of lamps, giving us weather reports, setting timers and alarms. It's making me lazy! Sometimes it doesn't hear my voice. Hears my husband's voice better. I find it best to put it pretty close to me on a side table.",4
174,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Love this. Just replaced my old echo with this one. Love Alexa.,5
175,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I recently purchased the Amazon show. It was easy to setup and use and I also added my own specialty screens and home screen. Extremely glad I bought it.,5

182,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Worked as advertised - easy to set up and link to my wi-fi.,5
183,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I love how you are able to get a visual effect along with audio from Alexa,4
184,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","I think it is worth the sale price of $150.00 but it has limitations. For example it shows my calendar but you can only see the first item, then if you ask for more, you see the next 3 or so. I The screen is updating with trivia...some interesting some not so much. I bet the next generation is a lot better",4
185,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Everyone should have this product. It‚Äôs great to have when you are needing to see something and your hands are full or you can‚Äôt find your phone.,5
186,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","When I first read about Amazon Echo Show, I thought the sound quality would be inferior to Echo because of the small size, which to me would be a deal breaker. I read that the sound is actually superior to Echo & it is compatible with most existing security cameras, so I decided to buy one. Then Best Buy ran a strong promotion if you buy 2, so I caved and bought 2. (I have a number of Echo's and 2) Echo Dots in the house). I am completely BLOWN AWAY by Echo Show!! Here is a brief summary of thoughts: LIKES: 1- Substantially the Best Sound Quality of any Echo to date, with stronger bass, directional stereo, Dolby Audio & focused sound field to the front. You can rock out louder, with less sound to the sides & back, so you do not share your music to all, as does the Echo.2- The 8) Far Field microphones are more effective than Echo. 3- High resolution 7"" screen is perfect for a desk or kitchen. 4- Song lyrics are great! (Free optional setting to turn on lyrics). 5- Photos of the album cover & the band on all music are awesome! 6- 3) buttons on top: Mute / Camera Defeat with red on screen indicator; Volume UP & Volume Down. 7- Excellent resolution with built-in camera. 8- Auto presence detector turns Show screen on when you are detected. 9- Speak to Alexa, just as with Echo or Dot, & Show mutes the volume & shows what you asked on the screen, with the music volume lowered in the background. 10- Ask the forecast & you get written & verbal forecast. You also get a second screen showing the next 4 days, including real feel, a picture of the anticipated weather, chance of rain, etc. 11- Say: Alexa, show me the ""Front Porch"", or any of the numerous security cameras & within 2 seconds, there is a highly detailed live video with sound! 12- Video conference - I do not know anyone else with Show yet, so I cannot try this but call yourself & you can see the picture they will see to adjust your surroundings. 13- Uses the same power supply as Amazon Echo. 14- Sleek shape fits right in with contemporary surroundings (see photo of Show in the center of the desk with 2) 4K monitors & iPad Pro). 15- The touch screen sensitivity is perfect. 16- Build quality is First Rate! 17- Rubber feet protect any surface & are anti - slip. 18- Addictive! More than any other device, this is one you will want in the center of your desk, as shown in my photo, because once you add the video component, you will wonder how you enjoyed music, sports, & just about everything, without it! 19- See your shopping list. 20- See visual confirmation that the lights you ask Alexa to turn on actually turned on. DISLIKES: NONE! I would only offer one design option. I would offer an optional Amazon Echo Show Wireless Subwoofer for this beast, that you could buy later. It would work like the many Soundbars that include a Wireless Sub. That would allow SHOW to not only ROCK OUT, but to shake the walls at the same time!I am seriously planning to sell some Echos & Dots to pick up a couple more Shows. They are GREAT!!",5
187,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",This is actually for a gift. Second one I purchased But great priduct,5
188,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I‚Äôve asked itquestions and answers were unknown and could not help me,3

192,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","We love our echo. Use it everyday. One thing, it claims to pick up your voice from anywhere in the room, but that's not always the case. It's not a big deal, just get a little closer or louder and she follows the request/answers the question. Love it!",5
193,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Nice add on to work with Arlo pro cams or if you like to sing karaoke with alexa,5
194,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","At first I was concerned with the funny looking angle I saw on the pictures. The item was not displayed at the local store so I decided to take a chance. As an owner of the Echo Dot i figured it would work in the same manner and it does. I love that it works with the Arlo Pro. The screen is great and I soon figured out the reason for the funny angle of the item. The angled screen works great Only setback or recommendation would be to add a auxiliary output at the rear. Also you can watch prime movies, YouTube videos etc.",4
195,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","I bought the white version and have it in the kitchen. I use it for EVERYTHING, music, video, phone, security cams, news, weather. It's the perfect kitchen assistant.",4
196,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",This Alexa is the best one out of all them due to the screen feature,5
197,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I love everything about this Alexa... if you‚Äôre on the fence.. just buy it.. it does everything!!!,5
198,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",If you like the Amazon Echo or the echo Dot you will love this for me the best part is when you make list or listen to music it puts the words on the screen for you,5
199,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","For some time I have been searching for a replacement for my Sony DASH which had support discontinued recently. While I am sure that being a bedside ""smart"" alarm clock was not the primary goal of the Echo Show it does fit the bill nicely. This was my first Echo purchase and now I have multiple Echo's and HUE lights. Great system all around!",5
200,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","She is Alexa, better younger sister. Love her, and some of the new skills great",5
201,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",The show has a good picture and good sound...love using it to look things up,5
202,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",This is an awesome product. This is the first Echo product I owned and I purchased 2 to get $100 off. I was going to split with a friend but like this so much that I decided to keep both. I've being singing along with the stream song with lyrics while doing work in the kitchen and house and watching youtube videos. The videos on Youtube takes a more effort to find the ones I want but I think this will improve over time.,5
203,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","This Echo Show comes in handy. I use it almost as much as I thought I would. I am still learning all that it can do, but my favorite part is the screen. It‚Äôs not a huge deal, but if I could change one thing it would be a detachable power cable instead of hardwired.",5
204,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","It‚Äôs good, but not google smart, it answers when no one asks. Kind of spooky. The distinction in the voice context is absent",5
205,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I like the ease and usage of the amazon show. I have a amazon echo and I decided to upgrade to this for the video call. Overall great product!,5
206,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I have been transforming my house to a smart home. So far thus is my favorite. Does so much I learn more each day,5
207,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","The visuals entice utilizing the product with greater frequency. Easy to set up and works well. There should be a manual to accompany the product. Going online encourages the purchase of a book of directions, rather than a simple online manual.",4
208,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I enjoy getting recipes and news via Alexa. Great speakers.,5
209,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","I bought the echo after seeing it demonstrated by my brother. He proceeded to ask Alexa questions and Alexa would answer them immediately. He then asked it to pull up some songs which, it did right away. Then he asked it to call mom and it did that as well. Needless to say, i had to get one.",4
210,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I like the video feature for my doorbell. Wish it automatically showed a picture when door bell rung. Does not FaceTime. Maybe later. Also not all cameras are compatible.,5

212,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","We love it to control the whole house lighting with Phillips Hue bulbs, as well as just everyday use for alarms, reminders, questions, news and even adjusting A/C, and Pandora Music Playlists.

215,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","almost a week late from release date from ups but finally got this and set it up which was easy, Once in a while it doesn't hear you right but that's probably due to being 10 - 15 feet away with the tv on other than that no problems",4
216,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",This item was purchased as a gift for an annual holiday party. The recipient loved it.,5
217,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I am starting my smart home and this was an addition to what we had already which was the dot and echo. This is simple to set up and the kids can even control it!!,5
218,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","We bought this to view our Arlo Pro cameras on something other than our iPhones. The Show does a great job of this. It is a fantastic Alexa device. My minor complaints are that it is slightly smaller than expected and you can‚Äôt view YouTube videos on it. Not huge deals at all, but minutely disappointing.",4

226,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Purchased for my mom in a memory care center. She doesn‚Äôt have to answer the phone, we simply drop in and start talking until she sees us. Picture clarity awesome! Staff also aware of this camera feature and knows we drop in frequently.

229,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",It was a bit more involved getting set up but thereafter the function is simply talking to Alexia. The plug adapter to turn on and off lights TV is useful and certainly worth having.,2

231,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","THE ECHO SHOW WORKS WELL, BUT AT THIS TIME IT CANNOT CONNECT TO YOUTUBE. MAYBE WHEN AMAZON WAKES UP THE CONNECTION WILL BE RETURNED.",3
232,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","It's a lot of fun. To fully enjoy it, we had to get Amazon music unlimited. We bought four of them, so we can keep in touch with family. Alexa is very entertaining!",5

240,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","The Amazon Show is a great addition to the Smart Home, easy to set up and to link up with a hub.",5
241,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","The Echo Show is great but it is not just plug and play. The app directions are not understandable if you are having problems. However, the Amazon hot line was very helpful. But, who wants to have to call for help every week or two to keep things running. Alexa should be able to talk you through how to resolve her issues. All in all I am getting used to the features and like it.",4
242,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","This is the best assistant from Amazon, with the completion of the screen you can also see images from cameras and other devices!Simply awesome!",5
243,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","I am satisfied with this purchase, I can see my family now without doing tango, Skype & etc.. We can have different phones from iOS and android to see each other and it‚Äôs very clear thanks Amazon......",5
244,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",The echo show works very well with Bluetooth and WiFi. Great sound and screen. Recommend to anyone,5
245,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Works great! Now if my dogs would actually answer when I call it would be even better! They‚Äôre just not interested but at least I can see what they‚Äôre doing,5
246,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",i love the addition of my echo show to my other Alexa devices. Having the screen to read recipes and viiew notes is great!,5
247,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","If you are looking for something to help you keep more organized or keep you up to date with weather, markets, and the latest news the Amazon Echo Show is what you are looking for. Honestly, the product is top of the line technology, and is easy to use as long you are patient and work with it, and read the directions. The size of it is truly perfect; it honestly reminds me of the size of normal alarm clock that would have on a nightstand, and with that it truly can serve that purpose. It also has a touch screen, and I feel it is very durable and can stand to last. The sound quality is also superb, with dual 2-inch speakers. It has Bluetooth capabilities as well, but it only works with android, Samsung, Fire OS, IOS device, excluding Mac products. The Echo Show comes in two colors black and white. The product has many different features and functions, and they can accommodate pretty much anyone‚Äôs needs. The top feature is the Alexa App, which is an application in which you can call commands and ask it questions about most anything. Then I believe the music capabilities are truly amazing and how you can ask it to play almost any song or playlist whenever you want. Also you can tell it to volume up or down as well. Another new modernized technology it has is the capability to do hands free voice command Smart Home options. A couple things that could be improved, is sometimes that it does not fully hear your exact words, and it will search for something you aren‚Äôt expecting. The other function it could have is it could have single voice recognition to only several voices, so then you don‚Äôt have the entire room trying to mess with it constantly. The price is also fair as well, for its creative capabilities it has. So if you are trying to find some new technology to add to your home the Echo Show would be a great addition for you.",4

249,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","9.5/10 Rating ! This has to be one of the best AI products I have used in a while. The screen for an smart home device can be very useful. It really can't compete with the Google home because the Show just brings convenience without having to call it. I primarily use the show to turn on/off my smart lights, simple cooking measurements, simple math, travel time, store location hours, calling, and video calling.... and more. Everything else like, news, calendars, weather are already displayed on screen. Definitely worth it if you plan on using all the minimum features above.",5

264,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Bought the Echo Show because of the display and am not disappointed. The Echo was purchased for somebody as a gift but this was purchased for me and is working great. The only thing that I am disappointed with is that I have to go through Bluetooth to play my music which is on iTunes. The display is also very vivid and clear.,5
265,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Purchased this device at launch (2 pack for $384.xx) and now YouTube doesn't work. YouTube was one of the main features that I used. Without YouTube you'll be better off buying the $40 Echo Dot instead.,1

I expected this device to be slightly different as it is the only Amazon device I have with a screen. I was pleasantly surprised at the large number of helpful features that a screen could bring. It occasionally scrolls suggestions across the screen, and most of them have been very helpful. I'm planning on setting another one up at my 93 year old mothers house. She'll get a kick out of it also.",5
301,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Bought 3 of these for Christmas for my Family members.I‚Äôve had mine for a year in my Kitchen and just love it!So much you can do with it and works great with my 5 Arlo Pro cameras.Big plus...Amazon is Always updating the Show to do more.,5
302,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Despite a less than friendly price point (if you don't get it on sale), this Amazon item is well designed and delivers on the promises in the hype and product description. The emphasis with this item is ""show"", so it's no surprise that sound quality does not compare with the Echo, but if you want the convenience of a voice controlled screen other than your phone, this product delivers. It's value is even greater when paired with other smart devices such as security cams. Another added bonus comes when friends or family also have a Show, so that you can do ""drop in"", which is essentially visual phone calls. It's great for checking on elderly family because it does not require them to be technically savvy.",5
303,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Previously had 2 echo Dots in play at my home, so knew I wanted more from my Alexa. Echo show now in kitchen and allows easy review of youtube for entertainment and recipe instructions. Also like streaming music and having the lyrics stream, too!!! Very cool. Looking forward to Alexa learning more and more to respond to my questions on various topics. Hands free is the way to go.",5
304,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","The Alexa Show was purchased to replace another much older device and while the Show is a good device it is lacking in some aspects that I had in the older device. I'm not sure if I'm missing it in the Show but I was able to get internet cameras on the older device (such as San Diego Zoo Elephants) that you can't get on the Show. While certainly not a deal breaker it was fun to watch. Setup was pretty straight forward and easy. It is a good aspect that we can talk to the device and it knows what we want to a certain extent. It is very literal at times and you have to make sure you have the exact code words or you get something other than what you want. (such as ""play"" or ""start"" or ""open"") I use it as an alarm clock and it is quite easy to set up the same time for my week but it would be a little more difficult if you have to work one weekend day of the week and then 4 more or other combination. You would have to set up several different alarms, one for each day as far as I can see. Some of the alarm sound choices are a bit alarming, I don't really want to be terrified awake each day. I found one that was mellow and at a moderate sound level works well. It would be nice to be able to add your own alarm sounds so you could have it customized to what you'd like. I don't see that yet anywhere. Another thing about the alarm is if you try to dismiss it and touch the screen the wrong way it puts the alarm into snooze mode instead of turning it off. If you tell it to dismiss the alarm it works fine but there are times I'd rather not say anything at that time of day and just dismiss it with a swipe, which is possible, but very sensitive and if you miss, here comes snooze! Just little things that may get fixed in the future with enough feedback from the customers but some may not effect people as much as some people who have more impact with a particular anomaly. I am thinking of getting a thermostat that hooks to it so I can monitor and change the heat and cooling but that is in the future at this time. Hoping that works well when it arrives.It will be nice to raise the temp a degree in the cold of winter without having to get out of the warmth of the bed. All in all I'd say it's a good emerging technology but needs a little work. Considering this type of thing was science fiction not too long ago It's kind of where we're heading.",4
305,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Alexa Show is really well put together. The main reason for my purchase was to create my own 'surveillance system' linking my Ring Doorbell, and Ring Floodlights to view on command by Alexa on the Show Screen. Yes, you can talk to it, and get results for almost any query, but with the show, you get a lot more. The touch screen is great for video calls, especially when you install the Alexa App on your family cell phones. Alexa can scan items via UPC and order them on Amazon, or tell you where to get them. The recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you, but SHOWN to you. Also, when music plays, you can see the lyrics on screen (If you use Amazon Music to play the music). You can ask for a news briefing, and you SEE the news, highlights, etc. The speakers aren't quite up to the same standard as the echo series, but it's close. The sound fills the room nicely. When the Echo Show is not being immediately used, the screen shows a picture of your choice, making it a digital frame too. Overall, the device is very nice, and they are constantly releasing new skills for Alexa to use, so it seems like there is always something new to wow you. Turning on and off lights, adjusting your thermostat, playing music, viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties, there is WAY more to do with this device!",5
306,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I resisted getting this since I already have two Echo units and one Dot. Black Friday gave me reason to buy one. I LOVE IT twice as much as the regular Echo. The set up is faster and easier and I love the visuals. I use my Shopping List and To Do List A LOT and having it display and being able to edit it without logging into the app makes it so much more worth it. I may be getting another :),5
307,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",No real upgrades to the iPhone 7 from the 6. There is no learning curve for sure. However the camera is better and that is a plus.,4

312,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","I had an Alexa, but thought the show would be cool as it would allow me to link a camera to it, see videos for info I wanted to look up, play my prime video account. It would have been a 5 if I could see all prime shows/movies on it.",4

You can even use it like Skype with others who have a show.",5
316,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","My wife wanted this, so I got it as a gift.

Each room in my house has some kind of smart speaker (I have also Google Home devices).The Echo Show is the best device to use in a living room or kitchen.

361,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","I waited a couple months to review giving Amazon time to make this product equal to the SONY Dash from nearly a decade ago, it isn't the screen provides nothing of value and you can't turn of amazon tips! you have near zero customization can't even move the clock to the other side of the screen. And something that a sony dash did nearly 10 years ago pandora or prime music as an alarm! seriously this is the biggest fail! Run away from this half baked Amazon disaster!",1

368,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Its a great product, but for the cost, the speakers are not what they should be, and the screen is too small. Choosing what is desplayed on the screen is something i still have not figired out. Hopefully software updates will fix the minor problem, and a second generation will hopefully fix the hardware downfalls. Voice recognition is also not as good as the eco dot.

371,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","I had reservations for the purchase of this Echo show, they quickly eroded after setting it up and using it now since Christmas day. Everyone in my family loves the camera function, sound quality, picture resolution and basically everything about it!It isn't totally perfected yet but it is a work in progress when it comes to the skills and how you choose to use this device since it is definitely designed for Amazon and their customers. Versatile enough so that everyone could find something to enjoy from music, pictures, videos to having your favorite book read to you. One of my favorite features are the Ole time radio series offered in the skills. Takes you back in time as you relax and very similar to a good book. Just my preference and it does offer much more and new skills are daily being added. Although we have several echo dots everywhere, my 6yo loves to come to the echo show to hear her music or to see new pictures uploaded to our cloud. The sound is amazing for its size, that's a huge plus. Pictures are dynamic and so far the only issue with me anyway is it's shape. Slightly odd but it seems to blend into our decor pretty well. Hopefully newer and even better skills will be made as this is a real gem in the rough with tons of applications still ahead that it can be used for. I have it connected to our home security system, robot vacuum cleaner and at times to my cell phone. Taken all together it is useful, fun and a nice addition for our gadget loaded home.",5

381,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",My wife purchased this for me at Christmas.

Although it dims, the lowest setting is still very bright--like sleeping with a flashlight in your face. I hope they make fixes that will allow the screen to dim more. Also, not crazy about having a camera connected to the Internet on my nightstand. If you cover it up, the motion sensor then won't work. The sound is OK--not quite as good as the non-screen Echo--maybe because it's not omni-directional like the regular Echo. My enthusiasm for this device has subsided quite a bit because of these issues.",3

389,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Already had 2 and when these when BB had a BIG sale price, I couldn't order it fast enough! I can see my Nest cameras (another 5 * product), make video calls to other Show owners, voice calls to anyone else (except 911) and a whole host of skills that are being added almost daily. My only regret is not replacing my 2 remaining Echo Dots when they were on sale. I won't make that mistake on next big sale.I also received 2 of the 'other' home assistants included as free bonuses for buying a couple of other things. I thought that it was only fair to compare the two, disregarging the video aspects of Show. Amazon's Shows and Dots. Echos were like comparing Lambourgini to a '68 VW Bug. Setting up these things are like the expression I heard as a kid, ""Easier than fallin' of a log and not near as dangerous.""",5

461,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","The three star review is for the situation described here, not the quality of the unit. I ordered this online and picked it up in store. The package was very securely sealed the seals appeared to be factory. The Echo was wrapped in plastic and looked like it had never been out of the package. When I hooked it up, however, it said that the unit was registered to someone else. It wasn't a problem to get it registered to me and the unit works fine. I spoke to both Amazon and Target about this, and neither could tell me what happened. I was offered an exchange if I wished. I chose to keep the original unit, but I wanted to make others aware of the issue. I have one theory. Target has a buyer who purchased a lot of these for Target resale, and they are all registered to this person. I guess I'll never know. The Echo itself works fine and I'm very happy with it. After you hook it up, make sure to go to settings and download the latest updates. Then you should be good to go.",3

478,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","This does the same stuff as the traditional Echo or Echo Dot, except it has a screen. If you already liked the Echo's this is a good addition. The addition of the screen is neat, but certainly not essential. You can see daily news headlines and the weather scroll across the screen. You can watch any Arlo or similar cameras on it. You can watch YouTube and Amazon Video as well, but you'll probably just watch that on a phone, tablet or TV instead.",5
479,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I love the the ability to video chat and watch videos on how to do stuff,5
480,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Just love it. Some very innovative. Very user friendly,5
481,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",This was a Black Friday special and we knew we wanted a smart home assistant and Alexa worked well with the Ring doorbell system.

486,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Got this for my mother who's eye site has been failing to the point of not being able to dial the phone or write down appointments.

487,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Nice device. Good to enable drop in conversations. Some flash briefings. But overall still a little limited in effective use of video,3

I made 2 more purchases immediately after to put them in my office and living room. I love the lyrics when music is playing and looking at the forecast on the fly. They are a must have for a modern home.,5

502,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","I bought this for my elderly parents that refuse to get a smart phone.They loved it, and feel safer with it. I programmed it to call 911 if they fall and need help. Plus they can see the grand children without any confusion.",5
503,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Video integration it's big plus for video calling kids at home and quick check who's at the door when doorbell rings.,5

511,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Too many great things to say about the echo show! I have had an echo dot for a while but the new echo who adds video. I literally use it everyday multiple times a day. Great product Amazon!,5
512,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Great sound, easy set up. The screen seems sort of wasteful now that I've been playing with it. Maybe it has the capability to work as a digital picture frame....I'm just certain yet. I was able to set one picture to it...Not multiple. Would be nice if could be used for Hulu or Netflix and stuff since the picture and sound are so clear. I like the visual to do and shopping lists. Still worth the purchase. A good want to have...just not a must have...then again maybe I have not tapped into all it can do.",3
513,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Not only does it round out my collection of Alexa devices, I have two echos and one dot, it also works well with the Ring 2 Video Door Bell,I can see who is at my front door without opening it.",5

515,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Worthless, except as a regular echo and a poor excuse for video chat. I love my echo devices, bathroom, pool, kitchen, other places where I may need hands free, voice activated music and info. My wife bought me the 'newest, hottest' thing. I was skeptical but then thought I would use it to help on a project. Me ""Alexa find videos on f450 drone"" Alexa ""YouTube is not available"". Amazon won't directly sell chrome products, youtube won't play on echo show. Further testing shows the video call is more limited than iPhone or Android apps for video. So the most useful thing now is the same voice functions that my echos and dots perform. Unless I want to make all of my video calls and check the weather from a device I can move no more than 3 feet from an outlet.",1
516,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",It is a great product. It works great would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to buy one.,5
517,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Got this for my dad for Christmas. He likes that the speakers sound better. He also enjoys being able to make video calls with it.,5
518,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Great device for me because I already owned bunch of stuff that supports Alexa. Needs more skills. And need YouTube to work!,4
519,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",If you like video this goes along perfect ...a must buy,5
520,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Purchased the Echo Show for my wife and she loves it! Full of great information, weather and more.

521,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Only download was very slow and echo show didn‚Äôt make it worth having as a stand alone,3

523,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","I feel the audio on the show is the best when compared to the echo, echo 2.0, and obviously dot. Nice to have next to bed instead of a dot and an alarm clock",5
524,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",This amazon echo show is great for room monitoring. It was priced well and I find it useful.,5
525,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",We are new to connected home equipment. I got this for my wife in our kitchen. The only thing I wish was different would be that the Amazon Show would communicate directly with FaceTime rather than having to have someone download the Alexa app. Not a deal breaker by any means though. We love it,4
526,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I love my new Alexa Show. Checked prices thoroughly and Best Buy was was the ‚Äúbest‚Äù and 5 minutes away. Product is great. Easy setup and works as stated. Staff very helpful.

536,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","The Echo was so good, I ended up getting the Echo Show as well. At first it was a device that I enjoyed using for various reasons, one being that I could ask Alexa to watch any YouTube videos I wanted to watch. Then one day, I asked Alexa to play a video and she responded by saying,""Google is not supported on Echo Show."" Until YouTube comes back as a skill, the Echo Show probably isn't worth the extra money. I'd say stick with the Echo if you have Amazon Music or Spotify, or the Echo Dot if you only use the echo as part of your smart home.",3
537,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Having LOTS of fun with Alexa!

I use it for Amazon Prime videos, YouTube, music with lyrics, recipes, and viewing the nursery with Amazon Cloud cam. The speaker is louder than I thought. Good purchase but I‚Äôd like to see more features for the screen.",4
560,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",This is the main reason why I went with Amazon's Echo ecosystem vs Google Home. I bought one as a gift to my sister so I can easily videochat with my family. My niece and nephew tend to fight over the Echo Show when they want to sing along to their favorite songs with the lyrics on the screen. My only wish was that there was an HDMI out to connect it to a larger monitor. Huge missed opportunity in my opinion.,4
561,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I'm disappointed. Sometimes gives doesn't understand,3

569,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","This item is a great addition to your smart home, but just as the first gen Siri it is not all there yet. The kinks still needs to be worked out. Alexa does not have answers to a lot of things or commands. There's a long learning curve. Setting up with apps is a lot work. It's fun if your large circle is willing to spend the money to get one each. Great landline replacement.",4

575,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","We loved the Echo Dot, but the Show is exponentially better.

Also displays the time, since I got rid of cable and no longer have that it is nice to have a clock in the living room. Very easy to interact with!",5
598,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I really enjoy using Alexa even watch videos utube many things it's worth buying,4
599,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",My daughter can‚Äôt wait to get this set up in her room,4
600,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Great product that a whole family would enjoy. It‚Äôs a perfect addition to the household.,5
601,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Great sounds! Works great with Ring doorbell and nest cameras as well! :),5
602,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","We have all three Echo products in our house. Each with a different usage. Got the Show for my parents and sister as well to communicate as we all live in different places. More for my parents, its ease of use is ideal for them, no computer knowledge needed, speak and they can connect with us.",5
603,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Best New Adult Toy in years! Wish I had purchased one for my parents. LOVE IT!!!!,5
604,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I am so happy with this product. It is so helpful to use st any time of the day. I.can do things while I am lying in bed definitely recommend this product,5
605,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",You will be amazed how this works for many questions you ask and Alexa has the answer. However do not expect her to know everything. You will be happy with this purchase.,5
606,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Amazing. Voice recognition great at long distances. Amazon music great! Cant say enough good!,5
607,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Video calls work great and the screen is super informative.,5
608,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Between this product and Siri, AlexaIs much more useful and reliable. It controls many things in my home and is very dependable. Only one problem... commercials activate Alexa when it hears them.",5
609,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","I didn't think I needed Alexa to have a screen, but now I'm so glad we got this. When I ask to see my grocery list, it pops up on the screen. Also can do video calls from it. Really like our Alexa and the dots...we have them in almost every room of the house now.",5
610,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Wish the angle was adjustable. When this is sitting on a table or counter it is angled up and the further away from it you sit, the less likely it will see you in its view when trying to call someone. Love the Sirus XM update to play through this though. The speaker seems louder and better than the regular Echo, but that is just my thought. If you were able to get two for price of one, this is a deal worth taking.",4
611,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","We use it to talk to our granddaughter, play games, listen to music and check on the dog while we are at work! Awesome device! We already bought one for our kids also!",5
612,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","First bought the Dot to see if we liked it. We enjoyed it, but wanted a little more volume. When I saw that the Show was much louder and had the camera we decided it was the right choice. Now we have the Dot in the bedroom and the Show in the living room. For larger rooms the Show is a great choice.",5
613,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I got it for me and my brother for Christmas. Great gift. Great price. Very functional.,5

Highly recommend the echo.",5
616,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","I was against getting something in my house like this being skeptical about hackers watching thru the device. However, this is the greatest thing since sliced bread! It can do just about everything! And the sound is fantastic when steaming music! Being able to change the dish network channel by saying it is so convenient while hands are in the flour (for ex.)! Access to information is endless and immediate with her replies! We love it!",5
617,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","The show is our new best friend. We watch shows on it everyday at lunch time. And we end every night saying ‚ÄúAlexa, turn off screen‚Äù",5
618,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","this is pretty cool, we love ours, we listen to music and the sound is great, my kids are always asking her questions, we can call on it, set reminers, timers and alarms for us it was worth the price but one thing I dont like is that it nickles and dimes you, like even though I have a prime membership, all music is not available , I had to pay to upgrade to be able to listen to everything and it doesnt stop there, even though I upgraded it ,if you purchased the dots not everyone can play music at the same time, to do that youll have to pay to upgrade again. but even so I dont regret this purchase and the whole family enjoys it.",5
619,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Love it . Easy to use. No problems setting it up!!!!,5
620,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Very impressed; set up a little confusing, but overall a good experience. Still learning. However, Best Buy emails give away any gift secrets !! Had to reset my account to a work email address.",4
621,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Already an amazon consumer and user of Alexa to control home automation products. The Show is a great addition for us in the kitchen, displaying receipts and visualizing things that before could only be heard.",4
622,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",So easy to set up. Still learning what she can do. Happy so far.,5

629,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",It is very enjoyable to be able to listen to the music at any time and great for parties and poolside.,5
630,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","This is a very nice concept, and I think it will take on more usefulness as Alexa gains more skills. The design is a little clunky.... Google's version looks nicer, but I already has Alexa devices to tie in to.",4
631,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","The sound quality is good,Alexa responds to commands but their is room for improvement",3
632,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Very similar to FaceTime on an Apple product.You can watch someone show you how to do something, like a project you are working on. Instead of listening, you can see it!",5
633,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Alexa is now a family member. How have I lived my life without her I have no idea...........,5
634,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Nice except unlike a Google Home you can‚Äôt just ask it to play music. You eventually have to purchase their music after s free trial,4
635,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Alexa is there to answer those questions you do not have an answer for along with news and weather,5
636,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",This is a fantastic item & the person I bought it for loves it.,5
637,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Echo Show is everything I thought it would be and more. The alarm and music actions are the greatest.,5
638,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","It syncs with my Echo, displays slideshows, recipes, and lists, controls my Fire Stick, and sounds pretty good. It doesn't play You Tube videos but it does do a good job playing videos.",5
639,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","The Echo Show is hands down the best device of the Echo lineup. I‚Äôve bought at least one of everyone except the Tap. I use this to call and check on my grandparents, who I got one for Christmas. It‚Äôs amazing watching my arlo and ring cameras on the screen. Also watching news segments and looking at cooking recipes/videos is great. It‚Äôs also the easiest to set up of the Echo Devices, you don‚Äôt even need to use the app,",5

641,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I bought this for my business to monitor the arlo security cameras and it is amazing!,5
642,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","This is a perfect upgrade to my kitchen Amazon Echo. The speaker itself is a substantial upgrade over the Echo and Dot. I have it connected to my Nest security cams and it's great to check on my dogs when they are having play time in my fenced backyard. It can be a bit distracting with it's random invitations to ""try"" certain skills, but the distraction is worth it! This product absolutely represents the future that I imagined when I first watched Back to the Future 2 decades ago! The only con's that I can think of is sometimes Alexa doesn't hear me so well (same for the Echo and Dot) and it currently can't differentiate between users like Google Home can. I have had the Google Home too, and would highly recommend any of the Amazon devices over the Google Home.",5
643,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","This is my 5th Amazon Alexa product. I used to have the Alexa Echo, but moved that up to my bedroom. Now I use the Echo Show downstairs and has good sound quality. I also like that I can add my Home Security system to operate through it and can see all my cameras. Great product.",5
644,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Works well. Haven't been able to work out the local traffic yet.,5
645,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Love my amazon echo show however I wish Alexa knew a little bit more.,5
646,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I bought this as a gift for my daughter's 22nd birthday and she totally loved it. Now she's wanting me to buy a second one so that I can keep it on the first floor. She says we can communicate through them instead of yelling to each other. I think it was a great purchase so I think I'm going to have to buy another one.,5
647,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Works good. Have to be very careful with kids. Overall good product,4
648,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Addition to my system...love talking and seeing my BFF in ATL...SUITS MY OFFICE decor.,5
649,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Got this so Grandma could stay in touch with Grandchildren, Works great and easy to use",5
650,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","This is a great addition to the other Alexa products by Amazon. It works great in the kitchen. Better voice recognition and sound. The onscreen display and information are very helpful. The video capability is watching instructional videos or even playing music videos while working/cooking. It can also scroll personal photos as a picture display.All in all Echo Show is a wonderful addition. Well worth it, especially if you get it on sale.",5
651,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","It's neat. It does what all other amazon alexis' do, but a little more. I feel as if should still do more.",3
652,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",This is a great device when used with Ring camera and Hue lighting.,5
653,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Thoroughly enjoy my new show. Love the scrolling pictures.,5
654,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I brought my tube amplifier to Best Buy and my Magnolia rep hooked it up to a pair of B&W 700 Series 2 speakers. WOW...It sounded like Etta James was right in the room! Fantastic!,5
655,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Works great. Very responsive and quick. I love tying the whole house together with this and the echoes.,4
656,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Love the look- love the size- love that it is VISUAL!!,4
657,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I like it. Currently it is the only smart system with display. It makes it easier to talk to the device. My only issue with it that it has a slow processor.,4
658,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Yes, it‚Äôs a little glitchy sometimes. But so useful and fun! I‚Äôm hoping that over time Amazon will continue to improve on the errors in Alexa. When contacting customer service, it doesn‚Äôt seem like Amazon is very interested in learning the problems that need fixing though.",4
659,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Great item to upgrade your house. Works very well.,5
660,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Very cool - It fully incorporates all of my Smart Home products,5
661,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Very happy with adding Alexa to the kitchen! The Echo Show is great for looking up recipes, getting a weather and traffic up as I‚Äôm getting my morning coffee or just listening to music!",5
662,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Great for video calling grandparents who are not real tech savvy. They also enjoy music on demand.,4
663,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Less than useless Does not work with Amazon CloudCam. I purchased this from Best Buy to allow me to monitor my two Cloud Cams from my kitchen. I am VERY tech savvy and have numerous Alexa devices but have been unable to get it to work. I tried installing and enabling the Amazon CloudCam Skill, made sure there were no new updates for the Show (the Show automatically updated when I first plugged it in). The final straw was when the tech support rep told me you can‚Äôt use the Show with the CloudCam‚Äîand then was unable to connect me with someone who could actually solve the problem. Useless is no help; less than useless actually makes more work. The Echo Show is less than useless.",1
664,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",This is a great device that actually has a lot of usefulness to it. After about a week you're going to be wondering what else can I do? what else can this help you with? So my suggestion is to get one of these as a start. Then prioritize the purchase of an echo (not plus) and a spot.,5
665,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Makes things easy to do like listen to music, check the weather, hear the news,etc. just make sure you say ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù loans and clear. Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt hear you.",4
666,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Great to have for time, recipe, or entertainment I recommend everyone get it",5
667,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",This amazon product is amazing easy to set up and to use. I do recommend getting prime music with it for only 4.99 a month that‚Äôs a deal.,5
668,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",The family and I love Alexa view and once we got it we were hooked now everything in the house and outside is run by voice commands. The opportunities with this are endless.,5
669,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","I recently had purchased enough smart home devices to make this a good addition for the home. It works well with smart outlets, our Ring doorbell and fairly well with our Nest Thermostat.My only complaint is that sometimes for no reason it will start plying a movie trailer and it's hard to get it to stop. Still all in all we're happy with the purchase.",4
670,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","It can stream music really well and not just from Amazon.I was expecting it to be smart like Watson, but it is more like an Blank Stare. Amazon should look into predicting questions like during 2017 Superbowl Play Offs. Alexa was unable to display or update the Play Off Brackets. It understands my voice really well, were most telephone automated assistants rarely get what I am saying. It want pair to my Portable Bluetooth Speaker. It will pair to my cell phone, but only to receive Music from it.The Audio quality is varies with amplitude. With low amplitudes Alexa has booming sound making it hard to understand from across the room, but an amplitude setting of about 50% the audio becomes clear and understandable. I really like playing games like Jeopardy with Alexa. No climbing through the closet to find a box anymore, and when you do find it box half the pieces are missing.",4
671,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Amazon hit it out of the park with this one. I am able to connect this to NEST cams and Ring cams as well. Songs come with lyrics, sound and looks great.",5
672,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Echo Show does everything from weather to turning on/ off my lights,5
673,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I am so happy to have the Echo Show. I have been able to listen to Christmas songs and some country western music. It has so many other things to do with it that I can not wait to try some.,5
674,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",loved the echo show. my only complaint is that youtube will no longer be available on it. That is one of the main reasons I purchased this as a gift. Other than that the product is great. Easy to use.,4
675,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","This Amazon Echo is very user friendly, and provides hours of entertainment, with anything from recipes, news, videos, and Amazon music with the lyrics is like having your own Karaoke.",5
676,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I have multiple Echo devices so purchasing another was a no brainer. I enjoy this one as it is video capable. The only thing I wish they would add was a way to pivot the camera and or improve its low light capabilities for poorly lite rooms.,5
677,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","I have had the Echo Show for about a month now. So this review is from a new user whom has never had smart devices aside from cell phones. Alexa is great for listening to music, most of it free if you're an Amazon Prime member, pair your Echo device with a bluetooth speaker for awesome sound. Alexa works well with smart home devices such as light bulbs, outlets and thermostat. (Most of these are really easy to set up, so you don't have to be a very technical person.) All of which can be voice controlled or remotely via the Alexa app from your smart phone. If you have a friend with an Echo Show, you can make video calls via the devices or directly to a smart phone which is pretty awesome for family and friends whom live far away. As far as answering questions, do not expect the best answers. The Bing search engine needs some work. If you want to ask the questions she prompts you with on an Echo show, she's your girl, but if you want to know something, you might have to look it up yourself. IE; weather forecast, you get whatever Bing uses and the short version. If Bing would expand their horizons in searches, I would definitely 5 star this item. She does fairly well with recipes and shopping lists. I am going to be trying out the calendar sync portion of this with my wife after the holidays. All in all, very fun, helpful, item. It can order you pizza too.",4

684,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","I had looked at this for a while. I was thinking about purchasing it when Amazon was offering the buy on get the second one for less offer, but when both they and Best Buy dropped the price to $149 I jumped on it. It's perfect for my kitchen because I can use the screen to pull up recipes and I can video chat with my kids that live out of State. I would say that this is a great addition to any Smart Home.",5
685,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Absolutely love the Amazon Alexa devices, we now have six in our house and have them connected to Sonos, nest, Arlo and other devices",5
686,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I purchased it so the weather and info can be seen on the screen. At the time I never knew there was an echo spot or I would have tried that. The show sounds good however I wish there was a ring or something on top that would light up like the original alexa.,4

690,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Bought two of these. one for the living room and one for the bedroom. great when you dont feel like walking to the living room and need to talk to your significant other. honestly dont use it much, but when i do its great. music shopping stupid questions movie times etc.",5
691,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I bought this for our kitchen where we enjoy cooking and congregating. Streaming music is great and you can search for recipes just by asking Alexa.,5
692,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Our whole family loves, and uses this device for so many different features.

696,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I Searched online and talked with people for two weeks before purchasing. When I went to purchase the echo show amazon dropped the price. Love this product am glad I purchased it. Having a blast listening to any kind of music and asking questions.,5
697,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","So we added this to our Echo family of devices. It's nice to have screen, but I honestly don't find I use it as much as I thought I would. The video calling feature would be pretty great IF we knew more people with a video capable Echo device.... Also, we've had some technical issues that I haven't been able to resolve as of yet. Ultimately, this is a powerful little gadget and can be fun to pop on a movie while sitting at the kitchen bar counter. It's also awesome to be able to display our security camera feed for the outdoor cameras, but you should probably investigate it's features and your needs before splurging on this over one of the more 'traditional' echo devices. It's essentially an Alexa enabled tablet with a nice speaker, so something to think about.",4

702,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",The echo show is a great accessory to any house . It has a great picture on it and great sound . It‚Äôs simple to use . My wife uses it for recipes when cooking and making grocery lists . Also listens to music with crisp sound. Can ask Alexa pretty much anything .,5
703,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","This item seems great on the ads, but it reality it can‚Äôt do nearly as much. To get it to do more you have to download ‚Äúskills‚Äù, some of which work well and others of which do not. Some are reviewed, but many are not. Connecting is often difficult and sometimes the password you use has to be the same as your Alexa device (which no body tells you). I‚Äôm sure with some practice this device will be fun and useful, but learning to use it and sorting through the skills is a pain.",3
704,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Upgraded from echo to this and this is just what I needed. Works well with my new Ring door bell and security cameras. Love the versatility of this.,5
705,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Echo Show is a great addition to any home and we were thrilled to buy one for each of our children's families during this holiday season!,5
706,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","With this you can make calls to other echo shows. Or using the app you can call others that have the a show. I haven't used this feature yet since I'm the only one I know who has one. I can tell you that while using the app at home or away from home off the network you can call the show. I did this while at work to check it out and caught my son coming in the back door. I freaked him out but after he settled down we chatted via video chat for awhile and both agreed it was awesome! You could also just drop into the show from the app to check on the house or whatever, wherever you have it. Keep in mind you're only gonna see what it's pointed at. The camera doesn't move. Plus in its natural form it is tilted back slightly so it point upward. There are stands on amazon the correct the tilt to make it straight up and down. Almost forgot but the speakers are amazing! You can link multiple echos together to play music. I have the show in my living room an echo in my bedroom and the dot connected to a JBL speaker in another room. After set up through the app I can tell Alexa to play music and they all come to life.",5
707,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Love the new Echo Show! Picture is clear and the microphones pick up my voice from far away. My wife likes it for recipes on the go and the Show it is always thinking. Music sounds great coming from this small unit. It was the talk of Christmas!,5

I bought it for my mother who really couldn't ""relate"" to the Echo Dot. But she can read the output. I works seamlessly with my Apple Calendar so she can see her activities of the day. Also can call her Great Grandchildren just by talking, and see them too!",5
710,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I own a dot and a first gen echo and the sound from the show is way better than both of my other echoes. The video functions are nice but it is a pain to get it to play videos from my Amazon library. My family enjoys the calendar info and the news briefings that rotate on the screen.,5
711,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",We already love our other Alexa/Echo devices and this is our favorite. The drop in video chat feature is my favorite!,5

715,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I have dots and an echo and this just sounds better and looks better,4
716,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. The screen is big and alexa responds clearly and quickly.,5
717,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Bought it for my son & wife. They love it. Both thought they didn‚Äôt need it. They find that it is a lot of fun and very useful.,5

719,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I think this is one of Amazon best products ever. I first review the echo online and watch youtube video. It is better than I read or saw on line.,5
720,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","This device is seriously cool. The basic functions out of the box are nice, but some customization and configuration allow you to do so much more. My family loves the ability to play Amazon music with their voice. Smart home integration is a big draw!",5
721,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Nice device. We use it a lot in the kitchen and the home automation.,4
722,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",The video is pretty good and the speaker is better than I thought it would be.,4
723,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","If Amazon and Google can work things out, the Show will be amazing! We already loved the Echo and the Dot, and were looking forward to adding video. Unfortunately, YouTube is no longer on the Show, limiting the video content. If they can ever get it back, the Show will definitely be a 5 star product!",4
724,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","The show is definitely amazing, especially if you have the doorbell with video and security cameras, you can see it with echo show.",5
725,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I love this product! The possibilities are endless!,5
726,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",It's great! I love the hand free whatever you want. It plays videos on Amazon by just asking it to play. At work I can video call my girlfriend at home with the show as well. Highly recommend,5

730,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Promising product that has been getting better with software updates since release.,5
731,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I upgraded from Echo and have no regrets. I didn't liked design from day 1 but after mounting on the wall the screen looks good. I like it more then I except it. Much easier for reordering or shopping on Amazon.,5
732,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Amazon echo show working very well (as expected) and thanks to Amazon for adding more features on regular basis.,5
733,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","The Show is the new Alexa Device with a video screen. I like being able to see a screen when you ask questions, and you can view videos too. I also like that you can see the temperature, and date without having to ask. I like you can view a video of a recipe, not just see text. The one item missing from this great device is the capability to hook it up to your surround audio system.I have two dots and love them. The Show would be perfect if I could also hook it up to my audio system. Even though this feature does not exist, it still is a great product.",4
734,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Delivered on time and it looked good will hook it up next year.,5
735,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",This is the most amazing item. And very easy to use,5
736,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I use alexa to control my smart home and get internet information,4

738,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","bought these for family members out of state for Christmas, finding it is way more than expected. Can talk face to face with them, make shopping lists, listen to stories, play interactive trivia music games, is there no end to possibilities? They all LOVED their gift (thank you Best Buy for great sale to make affordable)...",5
739,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","We purchased the Echo Show after using the Dot for a couple of weeks. The first thing I noticed is that the Dot‚Äôs ability to pick up your voice is by far much better than the Show. However, I think the Show‚Äôs speaker is better for listening to music.The screen on the Show is handy for looking at recipes, seeing the shopping list or watching the timer. Could you live with just the Dot? Absolutely, but there are some nice features that make the Show a handy gadget to have around.",4
740,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Amazon show is pretty cool, It can help with things like cooking recipe, homework and other things. But it's restricted to only Amazon partner things. If Google comes out with something similar I would have definitely chosen that over the show. No YouTube.",3
741,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Love the Echo Show. Allows me to control lights, alarm, vacuum and lots of stuff. No brainer to set up. Make lists, keep up with calendar. Plays music. Tells jokes and sings‚Äîbadly but is fun. Couldn‚Äôt be happier with it.",5
742,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","We're still learning all the things this device can do. So far, We're very pleased.",4
743,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",The Show is a great little product. It has opened a lot of doors in the world of AI and home automation for me. It connected easily with my echo and dot and now I can stream music all over my house. The picture quality is outstanding. The only drawback is that Alexa doesn't have a very strong internet search engine.,5
744,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",We were interested in the Echo line of products after we purchased our Vivint security system. The Echo Show is a perfect addition. We are able to view our security cameras from the The Echo Show and it works great in general as an Echo with all its features.,5
745,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Great to talk and see family at anytime. Easy to use,5
746,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","I love having the screen available to use for certain tasks like streaming doorbell video, security camera footage, Amazon Prime music lyrics and videos, but I am disappointed that Amazon‚Äôs implementation of YouTube on the Echo Show violated Google's terms of service so they got the app pulled from the Show. Also, honestly, and anyone can prove it just through everyday use, but the Echo is just not as useful as Google Assistant with inquiries. It works pretty well with home automation but it just doesn't understand or can't help with about half of the inquiries I throw at it. I would have gone with a Google Home if there was one with a touchscreen. I would recommend it for those heavily invested in Amazon Prime and home automation.",4
747,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Love it Love it Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
748,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Love this. Just replaced my old echo with this one. Love Alexa.,5
749,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",This is great! Like having a robot brain in your house.,4
750,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Alexa Show is really well put together. The main reason for my purchase was to create my own 'surveillance system' linking my Ring Doorbell, and Ring Floodlights to view on command by Alexa on the Show Screen. Yes, you can talk to it, and get results for almost any query, but with the show, you get a lot more. The touch screen is great for video calls, especially when you install the Alexa App on your family cell phones. Alexa can scan items via UPC and order them on Amazon, or tell you where to get them. The recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you, but SHOWN to you. Also, when music plays, you can see the lyrics on screen (If you use Amazon Music to play the music). You can ask for a news briefing, and you SEE the news, highlights, etc. The speakers aren't quite up to the same standard as the echo series, but it's close. The sound fills the room nicely. When the Echo Show is not being immediately used, the screen shows a picture of your choice, making it a digital frame too. Overall, the device is very nice, and they are constantly releasing new skills for Alexa to use, so it seems like there is always something new to wow you. Turning on and off lights, adjusting your thermostat, playing music, viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties, there is WAY more to do with this device!",5
751,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",This is just what I was looking for. It does just what it says it does!,5
752,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","This is perfect for any home it gives up to date news, you can set alarms and do so much more. We love this product",5
753,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I couldn't believe how easy and fast the setup was. It's basically plug and play. I watched a video first and it took no more than 3 minutes to get going. You don't need any other equipment to set it up. The sound is unbelievable...better than my Bose.,5
754,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Upgraded from the echo to add video support for my cameras. Sound is much better,5
755,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","The Echo Dot is a great personal assistant, and right now the price is fantastic. It can give you the weather forecast, traffic reports, daily news brief, play music from Pandora or other steaming radio stations, and answer questions, all in a very small package.. .",5
756,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Addition to my system...love talking and seeing my BFF in ATL...SUITS MY OFFICE decor.,5
757,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","We love Alexa! Love being able to watch news briefings, seeing the lyrics to songs, and so much more! It's in our kitchen and we use it everyday!",5
758,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I bought this so my kids can talk to there Grandpa and it has been Great they call him all the time,5
759,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Now I can view my front door Ring system as well as all my Arlo cameras. Great products. If you have Echo Spot in each bedroom, you can video talk with your kids by dropping in. Love it",5
760,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Got this for my wife for Christmas. Was suppose to come wrapped but didn‚Äôt. Wife very happy. Avid amazon fan. Sound better then the echo.,5
761,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Use a lot of home automation and this is a great addtion. If you are not an Alexa or home automation fan I would recomend trying to catch this on sale, you may not need the screen a much as you think. The sound quality is great.",4
762,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",This is a great device that actually has a lot of usefulness to it. After about a week you're going to be wondering what else can I do? what else can this help you with? So my suggestion is to get one of these as a start. Then prioritize the purchase of an echo (not plus) and a spot.,5
763,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Awesome so far. Have used it as alarm clock, stereo, 2nd screen for movies (while multitasking on PC), news/weather, audiobooks, and more. The news flash can repeat itself at times, but I may have subscribed to too many subcategories, but a quick alexa - next skips right ahead. Still learning the variations of commands, and sometimes it hears what it wants to until I have to ar. tic. u. late. to the point of annoyance, but hey, this is still relatively new tech, and who would have imagined this 20 years or more ago",5
764,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I like it. Needs more features to really become a good product. Needs browsing capabilities.,4
765,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","This is a great addition to the other Alexa products by Amazon. It works great in the kitchen. Better voice recognition and sound. The onscreen display and information are very helpful. The video capability is watching instructional videos or even playing music videos while working/cooking. It can also scroll personal photos as a picture display.All in all Echo Show is a wonderful addition. Well worth it, especially if you get it on sale.",5
766,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Purchased this item for our daughter. She absolutely loves it!,5
767,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","After researching and reading endless reviews, I bought myself an early Christmas present in the Amazon Echo Show. Once I had it home, it was quickly set up and has been a joy to have since day one. Loved it so much I bought two more as gifts. So enjoying being able to see friends and family on a more regular basis with the video option. I‚Äôm sure as I learn more this will become even more useful. Great addition to my other Echo devices.",5
768,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Alexa is a wealth of knowledge and learning more and more every day.,5
769,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","I didn't think I needed Alexa to have a screen, but now I'm so glad we got this. When I ask to see my grocery list, it pops up on the screen. Also can do video calls from it. Really like our Alexa and the dots...we have them in almost every room of the house now.",5
770,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I am very pleased with the sound and picture quality. It does not link to direct tv.,4
771,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",This was a Black Friday special and we knew we wanted a smart home assistant and Alexa worked well with the Ring doorbell system. There are times when you have to ask her the same thing over and over until she figures it out but overall it was a food deal.,4
772,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Love talking face to face with family and friends back in the Philly area. It is easy to use and to stay in touch. I can show family things that I have recently bought by holding it up to the camera instead of having to go into a long description on a phone line.,5
773,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Once you have it, you can't live without it. Great product.",5
774,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",The show works great with my other products. Love it,5
775,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Love the echo show & the ability to communicate with smaller children without any effort or cell phones.,5
776,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",The echo show works very well with Bluetooth and WiFi. Great sound and screen. Recommend to anyone,5
777,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",All I really use it for is music. The read downfall is it‚Äôs not Bluetooth so it has to be plugged in 24/7,3
778,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I have all the echo products in this by far is the best it does everything . I love it!,5
779,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",We're hoping the Echo show will allow us to elevate our experiences using the screen options for calling family & friends as well as reading recipes etc.,5
780,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","So I was skeptical of Echo Show and the entire line to be honest. However, this technology has changed how our household operates. From my daily briefing in the morning, to tracking Santa with my 6 year old every morning learning interesting facts about Santa and several other things, I truly wish I would have bought this sooner. We have it integrated into our Cozi account so we can just ask Alexa to add items to various shopping lists instead of pulling out a phone and typing it in. We also have ADT Pulse and a Nest thermostat and the integration into those two platforms was so simple I couldn't believe it. My son loves to ask Alexa questions and in the mornings before school he is learning things instead of just watching a few minutes of a cartoon.Another highly used feature is the local forecast as my wife is a weather nut and always wants to know what the forecast for the area is. I am loving the Amazon Music now as well because we bought an Echo Dot just to integrate into our Bose whole house system so we can stream music all through the house now.If you are on the fence about getting the Echo Show like I was, just do it. It really is an amazing product!",5
781,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I will have one for all my rooms. I will also buy some for friends,5
782,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I can see my grandchildren when I call it is a great machine,5

784,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Absolutely Love the echo Show! It is in my kitchen. I love seeing my to do and shopping lists on there. My calendar is there too. Plus I scroll pictures on it from my Amazon prime photos. Love being able to get the daily news briefing from MPR every morning. Also use it for timing things. Would highly recommend it to Amazon prime members. Got it at a great price on sale prior to Christmas.,5
785,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Amazon built upon the success of their Echo. I'm really enjoying the convenience of the Echo with the added display.,5
786,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I have put this in the kitchen to use for recipes and controlling various devices.,4
787,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Not a very responsive program. Very limited information program. Not user friendly.,2

It‚Äôs simple to use . My wife uses it for recipes when cooking and making grocery lists . Also listens to music with crisp sound. Can ask Alexa pretty much anything .,5
789,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","The Amazon Echo Show is so much fun! I got it for my husband for Christmas and its absolutely more of a gift for myself! We also got hue lights and have set it up our routines. This show is so much fun! We listen to the news in the morning while making coffee, it wakes us up with slowly with the hue lights, we listen to music while cooking dinner... cant recommend it more! Because of this purchase, I am also buying a spot! We love the camera feature where you can ""drop in"" so we will continue buying these rather than the security cameras (for the inside at least where we just want to say hello or see our dog).",5
790,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Worked better than expected! Highly recommend the Echo Show,5

795,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","at first I wasnt sure if this was something I ""needed"" when I already have the echo but it was on sale for black friday so I thought why not. As soon as it was set up I understood why I ""needed"" this. It just enhances everything Alexa does! Being able to see what she says is great! Seeing and adjusting my shopping list by touch is amazing. I love walking in the room and seeing little news blurbs. It looks sleek and beautiful on my counter. I highly recommend this to anyone.",5
796,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Each and Every Version of Amazon Home Products have gotten better and better. This Amazon Home is the Cadillac of Amazon Home Products. The News Feed on the screen at all times along with the options and features that you can do with this is amazing. I love the ability to call my mom and dad and see what they are doing. They are only a couple of miles away but it is fun. I also love playing music on the device since most of songs include the words. You might find out that you have been singing the wrong lyrics for as long as you can remember.,5

801,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Less than useless Does not work with Amazon CloudCam. I purchased this from Best Buy to allow me to monitor my two Cloud Cams from my kitchen. I am VERY tech savvy and have numerous Alexa devices but have been unable to get it to work. I tried installing and enabling the Amazon CloudCam Skill, made sure there were no new updates for the Show (the Show automatically updated when I first plugged it in). The final straw was when the tech support rep told me you can‚Äôt use the Show with the CloudCam‚Äîand then was unable to connect me with someone who could actually solve the problem. Useless is no help; less than useless actually makes more work. The Echo Show is less than useless.",1

827,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Needs to be a stand alone device. I should have not required to use a tablet of Cell phone to make it work. Amazon needs to work on the technology on device.,2

829,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I have not used this as it is a gift for my parents. Will see how they like it.,4

835,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",The touch screen adds a new dimension to the Echo which comes in handy when ordering off of Amazon or reorders as well. I also like being able to view news briefings and song lyrics on the screen also. The Echo Show is the only way to go.,5
836,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","The Echo show screen is great, it is helpful with recipes, music etc. I use it to listen to music all the time. I am hoping someone in my family gets one soon so we can face time each other.",4

843,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","The Echo Show is great but it is not just plug and play. The app directions are not understandable if you are having problems. However, the Amazon hot line was very helpful. But, who wants to have to call for help every week or two to keep things running. Alexa should be able to talk you through how to resolve her issues. All in all I am getting used to the features and like it.",4
844,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Alexa runs my entire house. The Echo show is a great addition to the Echo family. Everyone needs one!,4

858,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",The show has some nice features but the audio quality isn‚Äôt the best for the price point. I got mine on sale and am just using it for a bedroom alarm clock. I can read the time without my glasses.I still use my Sonos Play 1 to listen to my sleep playlist and ny other music. Unless I missed something it seems like if I set the volume low at night to listen to music to go to sleep my alarm will not be loud enough. So I don‚Äôt use the Show for music much.,3
859,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Setting up the amazon show was a little tricky,but I managed to navigate through it. It‚Äôs so cool to add compatible equipment.",4
860,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Great for video calling grandparents who are not real tech savvy. They also enjoy music on demand.,4

863,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I am so happy to have the Echo Show. I have been able to listen to Christmas songs and some country western music. It has so many other things to do with it that I can not wait to try some.,5
864,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","When I purchased this item, I was unaware how much it really does. I can literally control my entire home with it.",5
865,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Echo Show is everything I thought it would be and more. The alarm and music actions are the greatest.,5

868,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","Ok so i normally do not like this kind of stuff, but to be honest Alexa has been great, not only do we use it for fun stuff like music while cooking, or being able to multi task much easier, it fit in seamlessly with our home security system, added a extra cam, and really does add something extra to the home",5
869,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Video integration it's big plus for video calling kids at home and quick check who's at the door when doorbell rings.,5
870,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",The show has a good picture and good sound...love using it to look things up,5
871,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",I bought this as a gift. As far as know it works fine,5
872,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",The unit does a good job of playing music from Amazon music. It hears your voice very good although it gets confused at times when I tell it to turn on a particular lamp and I have to slowly pronunciate it. Like that the music shows the lyrics. Do need a family account on Amazon music to plan different music on different units in different rooms at the same time though.,5
873,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","I had reservations for the purchase of this Echo show, they quickly eroded after setting it up and using it now since Christmas day. Everyone in my family loves the camera function, sound quality, picture resolution and basically everything about it!It isn't totally perfected yet but it is a work in progress when it comes to the skills and how you choose to use this device since it is definitely designed for Amazon and their customers. Versatile enough so that everyone could find something to enjoy from music, pictures, videos to having your favorite book read to you. One of my favorite features are the Ole time radio series offered in the skills. Takes you back in time as you relax and very similar to a good book. Just my preference and it does offer much more and new skills are daily being added. Although we have several echo dots everywhere, my 6yo loves to come to the echo show to hear her music or to see new pictures uploaded to our cloud. The sound is amazing for its size, that's a huge plus. Pictures are dynamic and so far the only issue with me anyway is it's shape. Slightly odd but it seems to blend into our decor pretty well. Hopefully newer and even better skills will be made as this is a real gem in the rough with tons of applications still ahead that it can be used for. I have it connected to our home security system, robot vacuum cleaner and at times to my cell phone. Taken all together it is useful, fun and a nice addition for our gadget loaded home.",5
874,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Added screen a great features visual effect a plus,4
875,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",We use echo almost every day. It is fun to ask questions. The music is great. We check the weather and listen to NPRnews,5
876,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","I picked up the show on a Black Friday deal. I probably would never have paid full price. I am glad I have the show, it is actually quite useful. The sound quality is also better than the standard echo. At the moment, my only complaints are the lack of YouTube support and the price.. It will be interesting to see what features Amazon will add to the show in the future.",4
877,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",This is an awesome product. This is the first Echo product I owned and I purchased 2 to get $100 off. I was going to split with a friend but like this so much that I decided to keep both. I've being singing along with the stream song with lyrics while doing work in the kitchen and house and watching youtube videos. The videos on Youtube takes a more effort to find the ones I want but I think this will improve over time.,5
878,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","I love all of my Amazon echo devices. Right now it doesn't allow YouTube, but hopefully they will reach an agreement and fix that.",5

882,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",The first thing we noticed was Alexa‚Äôs response time to questions. No waiting or downloading just lightning quick responses. 2nd was the compatibility with our smart hone features. She connects to our lights and security monitoring system with ease. She is clear and concise.,5
883,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Product is great. It is Easy to use and easy to set up,5

885,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Alexa can make you crazy but it‚Äôs worth the aggravation.,4
886,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","This does the same things as the other echos but has a screen. The sound is comparable to the echo which is good. The screen is small, not hd, and not touch screen. You only can call other echo users.If you have an echo don't run out and buy you can do all on a laptop. If you are looking at an echo having the screen might be worth the extra bucks,",3
887,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Upgraded from echo to this and this is just what I needed. Works well with my new Ring door bell and security cameras. Love the versatility of this.,5
888,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Alexa is great and even better with a screen to show you all your searches and videos,4
889,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","First bought the Dot to see if we liked it. We enjoyed it, but wanted a little more volume. When I saw that the Show was much louder and had the camera we decided it was the right choice. Now we have the Dot in the bedroom and the Show in the living room. For larger rooms the Show is a great choice.",5
890,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",Great product will recommend it to friends and family.,4
891,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","I was hesitant, and I am now hooked. This is both fun and useful",5
892,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",The Show sounds significantly better than the echo plus. And the added screen features are nice. I just wish the ‚Äúthings to try section‚Äù would go away,5
893,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware","This Amazon Echo is very user friendly, and provides hours of entertainment, with anything from recipes, news, videos, and Amazon music with the lyrics is like having your own Karaoke.",5

After using for a week, we decided to return the Echo Show. Alexa just isn't ready for prime time. 90% of the time we got the ""I can't answer that"" response to questions. It's a waste of money for us. Say ""Alexa, Say good bye!""",3
897,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",This product ties in to the Amazon ecosystem better than the Dot or Echo.

I contacted Elite Plus and after a very long go around was told I would get a $20 credit on the best buy gift card that I used as part of the payment.

I had to get to a senior person to help me figure be out why audible did not work and the to disable the family features ... even then, I could not disable the Alexa app. My child has full access to Alexa and the rights to turn on shopping.... kind of scary.So my disappointment is that Amazon does not make a kid friendly kindle that we can have audible.com on for my child's learning disability.",4

I can set the tablet so when my older kids (10 and 8) log in, they need to complete educational tasks for an allotted amount of time before free play... and the whole thing logs out after a certain time so I don't have to go searching for it in their rooms at night :) great tablet, glad I got the bumper too, great price",5

And you should definitely pay the extra $20 (for a total of $69) and get the 16 GB tablet. Is it the fastest tablet out there? Definitely not. Does it quickly do all sorts of business spreadsheets applications, etc? No. Does it do everything that an i-pad etc can do? No. But at this price point it can't be beat. People say that you can't download chrome and the google playstore. They are WRONG. I have both on this tablet and my other fire, without rooting them. And with the ability to add a 128 GB card it's a no brainer if you want to play games, watch movies/tv, surf the net, email etc. I know there are a lot of people who dislike Amazon and their products, but I am obviously not one of them.",5

My mother bought him a subscription to the ABC Mouse learning program and we needed a kid friendly device for him to use it on. At first I was skeptical about spending the extra 50 for the kids fire as I thought it was mainly for the case which I thought to be cheap silicon. When the tablet arrived in the mail I was surprised to find that the enclosure is a thick, heavy duty type of foam. It provides a good enclosure for the kids to hang onto as well as a solid defender against any drops. It booted up quickly and once you enter your amazon information, you have the ability to set up both an account for adults and a child's account.The child's account does not have access to the app store or anything that you don't want them to get a hold of.You can set time limits on their account to your desire.You can allow and disallow any application you want to their account.It comes with a year subscription to amazons free time unlimited, which I interpreted as basically Prime for kids. This allows access to all the apps and games as much as they want.The kids user interface is extremely slim and easy to navigate. He is able to one click to any apps, books, games he wants to use. It also highlights your recently used apps in the carousel at the top.Overall I'm very happy with the purchase of this tablet as it allows him to use modern technology to learn and grow without worrying about the normal dangers the Internet holds if you're not careful.",5

2364,"All-New Fire HD 8 Tablet, 8 HD Display, Wi-Fi, 32 GB - Includes Special Offers, Blue",Electronics,"I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of ""back"" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the ""X"" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of ""new items."" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under ""new items"" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the ""home"" menu. It's the ""recent"" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's ""On Deck"" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the ""on deck"" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you.",4

While home, I download the books that I want to read and then while I am in the car or waiting at the DMV, I just pull of the book and read. It remembers where I am in the book. This Kindle does not have the back light. I was nervous about that but so far this has not been a problem because the light it has is fine for me. When I am reading in the car, I enlarge the font and it makes seeing the words easier for me. That is the most important factor for me because I can get car sick if I read while riding in the car but with the larger font I don't have that problem. I wear glasses with bifocals and holding this seems to be more comfortable than a book because I can hold it up if I need to. The size is perfect! Again, I can enlarge the font so the smaller screen size really has nothing to do with the readability. Love it!!",5

Overall, everyone must have Kindle with them and this is the best product/model to start with.Understandably, this is the beginner level model for people who never used Kindle before. Features like LED lights, White paper background are not available on this model. These features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in Dark without lights.

2466,"Fire Kids Edition Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB, Green Kid-Proof Case",Electronics,There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen.

2484,"Fire Kids Edition Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB, Green Kid-Proof Case",Electronics,"The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable.",1

The modified Android operating system with Amazon features built-in is great. I am reviewing for what it is, a KIDS TABLET. It has a 1.3 gigahertz processor, meaning for such a small device that decently enough. Internal memory is 8 gigs but you can expand to 256 gigabytes. You wont run out of memory. It has a 2 megapixel camera that shoots in 720p, meaning not full 1080 hd or 4k. Again, if you bought it for a camera you'd be wrong, but for a kid 2 years to 12 years old, that's good. It has 1 gig of ram so it is kind of sluggish on more detailed games. Our 2 year old isn't playing any heavy graphics games that take up the CPU and GPU. It came with a nice rubber case for drop protection and she has thrown it a few times excitedly and it did its job. It has no resource hogging GPS or RADIO but it does have bluetooth and Wi-Fi.",5

Pros: The rubber case allows the tablet to take quite a beating, which was crucial for this purchase. Another huge pro is that adults can use the tablet under their own sign-on which works like any other tablet. From the adult sign-on you can customize what your kids can watch, screen time allowance, and add or remove apps for them. The price isn't bad compared to the price of adult tabletsCons:Kind of bummed I can't link my Google Play apps I purchased but I guess it makes sense this is not a Google/Android product.

3015,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"Enjoying my Tap, asking Alexa questions, and the small form factor makes it easy to take along while traveling. Decent battery life and sound for such a small speaker. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars, was the difficulty in connecting the Tap to public wifi's such as hotels, in my situation...takes some effort.",4
3016,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"Bought the Echo Tap, Echo Dot, Phillips Hue Starter Kit and a Honeywell Thermostat for my wife for her birthday.She loves it and so do I!Cant wait to add more automated products to it. No need to have my phone out fumbling through multiple apps to change lighting and temperature, check weather, play music, etc., I just ask Alexa to do it while I continue at what I'm doing.Also, when the Dot and Tap are in the same room, the one that is closest to you typically answers your requests.

3027,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"Seriously a flawless, portable, smart, multipurpose gadget. Add this to the incredible Flash Sale price and I'd have been a fool to pass it up. Fast charge, balanced tuning, easy to pair and did I mention highly portable? The cradle is a sweet design too. The only beef I have is that YOUR BLUETOOTH IS PAIRED screaming at you when syncing. Own one of these-",5
3028,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,The only thing I have to recommend is that it will not hook up with a blue tooth device. Why is that?,5
3029,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"Overall good, not great. I get tired of having to push the button to talk to her and she can't find a lot of the music I liked. Am getting some Dots to see how they will work. For price point it works.",4

3046,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"The Ultimate Bluetooth speaker...I have multiple Amazon Echos and a Whole Echo System set up in my house. I Love Everything Amazon...I can't stand Apple but now I know how they feel...I am a Cult Member of Amazon!!! LOL So anyway...I have been trashing this device...The Tap...because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things I like most about the Echo. The only flaw of the Echo is it is not portable..I tried the Triby but I did not like it...more for little kids. So on Black Friday the Amazon Tap was on super sale so I bought it. The Tap is smaller than I thought it was...about 2/3rd the size of the Echo..which is perfect for portability...But don't let the size fool you the sound is only short of Bose when it comes to volume and sound quality. Important note...You don't have to have an Echo to use this device...just The Alexa App on your smart phone. The Tap does everything the Echo does..It is an Amazing Bluetooth speaker...AND IT""S PORTABLE!!! Automatically switches/remembers different WiFi areas and can be used with a Hot Spot. The Most Amazing thing about the Whole Amazon Echo System is that Amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly. Meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does...Some things Even better than Google Now...and Light Years ahead of Siri. The Tap is my new favorite device...it is PERFECT!!! The only flaw is that it IS NOT waterproof...Amazon if you are listening make the next Tap waterproof!!!",5

This speaker fits the bill as you can disable order by Alexa, and you have to manually push the listen button for the mic to pick up sound. The speaker quality is great for a portable option. The only thing that I don't like is the charging stand can lose connection if its not sitting just right, but I can't knock a star for this as they allow you to plug the cable directly into the unit itself which solves the problem.",5

3079,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"I bought one for myself and a couple as gifts, it's cute but still haven't figured out what's so great about it. I will say that it does pick up your voice throughout a huge room.",3

3081,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,I would recommend this Prouducts it had great full sound full sound with a conpack,4
3082,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"Picked this up to have a portable option for playing music in the garage. Love that it's battery powered. Never had an issue of it running out of juice. The only issue I have is with the mics, it doesn't respond to your voice as well as the Echo or Dot. Then again it wasn't really designed to listen for the Alexa command since it originally required you to ""tap"" the speaker to get it to listen.",4
3083,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"The tap is a great concept, I love my echo so a portable one was that much better. However the sound is pretty terrible, no bass and can be scratchy.. It was a good concept just poor execution.",2

3089,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"I was an early adoptor of the Amazon Echo, when I heard they were releasing a mobile version I wanted it.

3096,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"Love it, works better than anticipated. Also at a good price",5
3097,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,When it works it's great but for some reason it doesn't always answer me When it doesn't answer me I turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn't work at that time. It was easy to set up with the phone app. Doesn't seem to matter where the phone is when it isn't working. I've tried close and far and in between. So a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn't,3
3098,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"We have bought two Taps, one for ourselves and one as a gift for our son. We love the portability of the Tap. It's perfect for our deck. Our grandchildren love it, too.",5

3109,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"Love the Amazon Alexa products! I have 1 Show, 1 Echo, 2 dots, and the Tap. Wish the Tap had the drop-in feature. The tap does make a sound when you have the hands free enabled and say ""Alexa"" instead of the blue lights on the other products. Great for taking outside!",5
3110,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"The Tap is a great portable speaker with fantastic sound. If you press a button then you can connect to Amazon Alexa and she can play your music, answer questions, etc. Downgraded one star because there is supposed to be a hands free option for Alexa but I haven't been able to get it to work. Still great to be able to take this around the house vs Echo which is tied to the plug.",4
3111,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"Full disclosure. I own five Amazon echos including a few Dots as well as this Tap, so obviously I'm a fan of echoes. Honestly I couldn't figure out from Amazons marketing and the online review how the Tap fit in as compared to full blown Echo and the Dot. I kept thinking it was limited compared to the Echo and the Dot because you had to Tap the button to ask it question. However given that it's completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would wast battery if it was always listening for a voice command. IMO, the Tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the Echo in a much smaller form factor. Since it's portable it's probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someways is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music. My friends and I get into fun wars asking for different music on the full blown Echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone plays Michael Bolton over my Bruce Springsteen. Bottom line just as good of sound as the full blown Tap in a portable and smaller form. Very Happy with all my echoes but this may be my favorite.",5
3112,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"Great sound and portablebility. Nice style, lithium battery, requires wifi and there are internet radio stations and news. Amazon has features available as well. I use mine a lot.",5

3116,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,Great sound. Portable. The kids love it. Didn't think I would use it but I tend to use it a lot.,5
3117,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,Most speaker like this will be over USD150.00 but this one is less than that price with a great sound quality,5
3118,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,I love this little speaker. It is small enough to carry it wherever I want to bring it yet loud enough to be heard The Alexa interface is pretty cool as well. The only issue for me is that it doesn't connect with Apple Music. This issue is easily resolved by putting Tap in Bluetooth mode and playing Apple Music through my phone to the Tap,4
3119,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"Speaker is pretty loud and I love that I can take with me but the only downside is you have to hold the ""home"" button to use Alexa",3

Love how the weather, traffic, movies and sports scores/schedules are answered quickly and effortlessly. This was an excellent gift as I gave it to both my son and daughter and my son, unknowingly gave we a Tap back as well. Can't wait to see what improvements are made with the updates coming",4
3142,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"I got it on a pretty good sale... so I feel it was worth it. The sound is good, I like that it's portable and rechargeable. I think it is best if you have a prime account so you have access to the prime music.",5
3143,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,Alexa works great and does lots of things for you. Fun for the family.,5
3144,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"For the price, you should be able to use as a speaker when talking on the phone. I had to use my daughter's Beats Pill for this function, therefore it's not worth all the hype.",2
3145,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"The Tap is essentially a smaller version of the Echo that has Alexa capability like Echo does, but also doubles as a portable Bluetooth speaker. You do need to tap it to ask Alexa to do anything, but otherwise it works the same as Echo. I prefer the Echo, but the Tap is great for college students and those who just want to supplement their Echo.",4
3146,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,It's not bad for the novelty of Alexa. Might as well get the echo. Sound it not bad and I'm no audiophile. Might be good when my echo dots come in. Is it worth it? There are better Bluetooth speakers out there.,4
3147,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,I prefer spending the extra $70 or $80 to get the echo,4

That button!!I would give this 5 stars and buy more of them, IF it was always listening while plugged in. Other than that, it does everything an Echo does, it's smaller, and (due to the battery) portable. I like it - I do. But it's not as useful as the Echo in the situation I use it the most.",4
3150,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,Amazing Sound! All around great product! Nothing negative so far.,5
3151,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,I have an Alexa but wanted a speaker for traveling. You can use this without a plug in cord.,4
3152,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"If you want a certain level of privacy and at the same time a speech enabled assistant, then this is the product for you. The Tap only listens to your, when you push the ""button, otherwise it is deaf to its surroundings.

3154,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"I'm thinking this must of been a fluke, it never worked. Had to return item but received full refund",2
3155,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,I habe the echo and I bought this one fort my son's room but it's not as user friendly. I wish I would've just bought the other one.,2
3156,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,I have two Echo Dots and wanted something that was more portable for other times when I'm not near those two devices in my home. I also needed a speaker so I thought I'd try the Echo Tap. You can choose to just press it to activate or you can enable hands-free and it will respond just like my Echo Dot does. The sound is amazing out of this little thing. I love the charging dock. No dealing with trying to plug it in... just sit it down on the charging dock and you're good.,5
3157,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"Good price, travels well, has a lot of good features, compact, user friendly.",4
3158,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,I already own an echo dot but don't love the sound quality for music playback - the tab does a great job especially when you consider its size and price - overall very happy,5
3159,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"Was super easy to connect via Bluetooth - great sound, fun to use.",4
3160,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"I only purchased this because I loved the sound quality. Alexa is just a added bonus personally as I rarely hit the ""tap"" button to ask her anything. The few times I asked her questions, she hasn't disappointed. EXTRA: Now what would make this device amazing is if Alexa was able to connect to my Apple Music playlist! If only...",5
3161,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"This is my second Echo purchase. My first was the original Echo for my home and the automation feature aside. The sound is excellent, Alexa's response is better than any digital assistant to date, and the ready access to Prime is convenient. This is all of that and portable and rechargeable as well. Additionally the inclusion of Bluetooth and a headphone jack is amazing.",5
3162,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"Echo sounds better for music, but Tap gives me portability. Good to have both. Now Tap is voice activated, so it's all good.",4
3163,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,Best speaker with Alexa enabled. Value of money!!,5
3164,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,Has a very good Bluetooth speakers sound quality is good but otherwise she's pretty useless when it comes to get answering questions,1
3165,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,I bought this item on a whim and because it was on sale. I've been pleasantly surprised. Search sounds great for its size.,4
3166,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,We love our Amazon Echo but it is hard wired to kitchen. Because of where we live AM reception is poor but through an Echo or Amazon Tap I can listen to some of my favorite stations through iHeart Radio and the Tap is portable.,5
3167,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,I love my tap. It sounds great and is so easy to use.,5
3168,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,Bought it for a couple of my friends and it was a big hit with them! Very useful!,5
3169,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,I bought this as a gift for Christmas and it was well liked,5
3170,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"Much better than the echo dot. However, the fact that you have to touch the button to activate it instead of just talking to it is a bit annoying. Speaker is fairly powerful for its size.",3
3171,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"Great addition to my Alexa collection. Very portable, batter lasts as expected.",5
3172,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"It's so fantastic to just ask a device to turn on lights, or play music. So convenient. Love this!",5
3173,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"I bought this after I bought the Amazon Echo. This was actually an impulse buy. I saw it and bought it not reading any reviews on it, because I enjoyed the echo so much. It does everything the Echo does, but the sound quality is not great. When you're playing at middle volume, it's ok. The lows are there but doesn't sound good. I'm guessing I'm comparing it with the Bose mini soundlink. When you set the volume high, the bass is almost non-existent. The mids and highs are loud with the louder volume. Another difference is that with tap, you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo, you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands. I do like the fact that it's portable. Because of that, I'm on edge of returning it and holding off until maybe another model comes out with better bass.",4
3174,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"I wasn't sure how we would like the tap, but I must say it has been fun talking to Alexa. I like asking her to tell me a joke, play my favorite radio station or play music. The fun continues as I add apps and Alexa expands her knowledge base.",4
3175,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,Great sound and functionality. Minimal kinks in programming. Love it for my bedroom.,5
3176,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"The echo is great for music, weather, and anything else you have integrated in the house.",5
3177,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"this is a very good product, the speakers are good, the price was right. I liked everything about it, other than the fact that you had to press the button each time you wanted to talk to it, unlike the echo and the dot. The portability was good, but I didn't have much use for it being portable. Unless you are going to keep the Tap within arm's reach, you're better off with one of the other hands free voice activated products. recommended with caveats",4
3178,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,It makes me so happy to listen all kind of their music station,5
3179,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,This is the best of both worlds. A reasonably priced BT speaker and an Amazon Alexa enabled device. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a BT speaker and considering an Alexa enabled device.,5
3180,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,The Amazon tap I like other then I wish you could just say her name and she would respond. Sounds great when playing music,5
3181,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"Used it as a bluetooth speaker and love how I can use Spotify with it....just say Alexa, and ask for your favorite artist.....",4
3182,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"I was debating whether to get the stationary Alexa device or the Tap and decided on portability. It's been fun figuring out how to phrase requests but with a little trial and error we're on a roll. I use it for play lists at work, alarm clock announcement by Dan Marino and news briefs. It's surprisingly sturdy but wish it was waterproof so I could take it with me while fishing.",5
3183,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,Haven't been able to train Alexa like we've heard. Probably our own fault. We have fun with it.,4
3184,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"Thoughts of being able to have the Echo ""grow"" as I added to the list of tasks, excited me. Including the latest app, having it to recognize my smartphone's contact list to place and to receive calls. However, the Echo I purchased does not link up to my Samsung smartphone. Disappointed is a understatement.",4
3185,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,Was easy to set up. Excellent sound quality for the price,5
3186,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"I was looking for just a Bluetooth speaker to add to my laptop for better sound. When I first listened to Amazon Tap I was so impressed with the sound quality.....then add in all the features it was a no brainer for a purchase! Sound quality is off the charts, Alexa learns more every day, and so do I! If you are a Prime member, this is a must! If you aren't...then you really should be!",5
3187,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,Amazon tap is one of my best buys this year so far...The only thing that could make the tap better is an upgrade so you don't have to tap every command....That would make it a 5star device....,4

3192,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"Love this product. It is nice looking, easy to carry, and the sound is amazing. Very easy to set up and connect to amazon echo. Nothing to complain about th he speaker itself. However the carrying case is kind of stupid and useless also. One has to take it down just in order to charge.",5
3193,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"I love everything about it.... it is portable, sounds better than most portable speakers, and Alexa rocks it. Only thing that kept it from a 5 star rating is that you have to manually activate Alexa. Wish it would work like the Echo and Dot, while it is on its base.",4
3194,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,We're in our 70s and and have a good time with it.,4
3195,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"Guys, the Tap does everything Echo does and it's portable! Use it at home for everything, at work on your desk for music, weather, etc, and even poolside as a portable speaker.",5

3197,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"This is a great product. I also have a Dot but the ability take this anywhere is a huge bonus, the hands free mode works just like the Dot, and the sound is great. I use the Tap all the time; working on projects, making shopping lists, playing games, to turning on the lights. I looked at the Echo but even with a battery pack it didn't seem very mobile.",5

3201,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,"I wouldn't buy it again...the software doesn't seem as well integrated with the hardware on this machine. I also have an Echo and I don't have the same connectivity issues with it that I do with this. I liked the features available with this...portability mainly with a long battery life, but with plagued by connectivity issues I can't say I would recommend it. I have looked at reviews online since purchasing and have discovered I am not the only one that feels this way. The sound, when it is connected and responding, is amazing.",3
3202,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,Great Bluetooth speaker with the added benefit of Alexa,4
3203,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,My wife uses the Tap mostly to listen to music. She loves the fact that she can take it into aNY room of the house. No more having to turn up the sound to hear I'm different parts of the house.,5

3218,"Kindle Oasis E-reader with Leather Charging Cover - Merlot, 6 High-Resolution Display (300 ppi), Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers","Electronics,Media","Even when I‚Äôm outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book I‚Äôm reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn‚Äôt heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I‚Äôm on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I‚Äôm sitting down. No matter what I‚Äôm doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won‚Äôt allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its ‚Äúdual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.‚Äù This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don‚Äôt occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don‚Äôt limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I‚Äôm done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don‚Äôt plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn‚Äôt needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren‚Äôt a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won‚Äôt appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn‚Äôt last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have.",5

I had one of the first Fire HD kindles that is still kicking and awesome, but when I saw this in the store I just had to have it. I think it's more user friendly and feels like it offers so many more options and functions than the Fire HD I have. Not to mention it dwarfs my last kindle in size. If I had to make one complaint, it's that there is not an ""auto brightness"" function (or at least I haven't found it) and you can't make your pages a cream color rather than stark white. Both those options were easier on my eyes, but I am testing out the Blue Shade mode to see if that helps as much as it's supposed to with night time/ bed time reading.

Best Buy is great, so this is not a reflection on them, just our experience with the product. We have had this product for just over one month and I have had to contact Amazon Support, perform factory resets to get content to show up, and the device is poorly designed as the SD card pops out constantly, which messes with DRM, and does you no good if this happens when you are not connected to the Internet to fix it. We are returning, and spending the extra money for an iPad. Will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience. If you just use the device for reading, maybe this is for you, but trying to download information to SD card and actually being able to access it has been beyond frustrating, as well as having to do factory resets so content owned/ already purchased on Amazon would show up on the device in the library.",1

I've noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you'll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn't. But then I don't plan on reading when it's raining or outside or while taking a bath.

3313,"Kindle Oasis E-reader with Leather Charging Cover - Merlot, 6 High-Resolution Display (300 ppi), Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers","Electronics,Media","When they first announced the Kindle Oasis, I did not have much of a desire to upgrade from my 1st generation Kindle Paperwhite. Just as I felt when they announced the Voyage.I read a lot, so my Kindle travels with me throughout the day most of the time. I have never had an issue with battery life, I have only had it get really low a few times (typically when I was traveling). So again, I originally did not see a lot of the value to the Oasis.As the reviews for the Oasis came out, I started to realize what I did not like about my Paperwhite, and I began to have an interest in upgrading my Paperwhite to the either the Oasis or possibly the Voyage. The main thing I noticed is that I took my Paperwhite out of the Amazon case quite a lot, especially when I was in a seated position. This slight reduction in weight made it much more comfortable to hold for longer reading sessions. I had some other minor issues with my Paperwhite, like when reading in the dark, I couldn't find an adjustment for the light that I preferred (5 was a little too dim and 6 was a brighter than I needed). I decided to pass on the Voyage because I really did not like the case options and the pressure sensitive page turn option.Now that I have the Oasis, I definitely think it was worth it for me. I really appreciate the reduced weight when the cover is off (not to mention the ease of removing the cover compared to the Paperwhite). It provides the same reading experience, although I did get a resolution upgrade compared to my older Paperwhite, which is a plus.The Oasis is really comfortable in my hand, which helps me forget that it is there. When I was holding my Paperwhite with my left hand, at times I would accidentally go back a page, which drove me crazy even though its just a minor inconvenience.I have the black model because it was the only option available unless I was willing to wait a few more months. The build quality of the Oasis and its case is very nice, just like with the Paperwhite and the amazon leather case for it. The only concern I have is how well it will protect the Kindle. I will update the review if I find this to be a problem.I loved my Paperwhite, and I will recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade from an older Kindle or buying one for the first time. It definitely is great and the better buy, but I am glad I decided to order the Oasis. The reduced weight, ergonomic design, and page turn buttons make it worth the added cost.",5

Maybe this isn't a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does.

Several upgrades later, I got this for a gift, and I think it basically includes everything that was missing. It is so lightweight and compact that I can easily slip it into my purse or use it with one hand. It has backlighting that doesn't disturb my sleeping husband or create a light so bright that it is distracting- it's just the right amount of light needed to read in different ligths.

3343,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,"Excellent Ereader if that is all you are looking for.

3344,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,"I have an old Kindle Touch, the last one that still had text-to-voice, which no longer works. I decided to upgrade, started reading the reviews, was enticed by the The Kindle Voyage and took the plunge. The Voyage is pretty and sleek, with neat features, and I enjoyed using it for a few days, but my frugal self just couldn't justify the price difference between it and the PaperWhite. While the ambient light sensor was nice, I often ended up just adjusting it manually because it was still a little bright in a completely dark room. I made more errors of turning a page than I meant to with the ""page turn"" because of where the page turn spots are located, plus, I'm in the habit of flipping pages on the phone or a tablet, so I kept swiping despite the availability of page turn. However, the clarity of the screen, the quality of the light, the form factor, the weight and the way it felt in my hand while reading were all very nice. Nonetheless, the price difference bothered me enough to return it and get the Paperwhite. The thing I miss most about the Voyage is the quality of the light, and how even the lighting is on it. The unit I had did not have blank spots or a yellowish top half of the page, or any of the lighting issues some reviewers mentioned with the Voyage. I purchased the newest model of the Paperwhite and I like it, but the lighting appears pretty dingy. However, it's only when they're compared side-to-side that I wished I wasn't so cost conscious. If money is not an object, I'd say get the Kindle Voyage, if it is, the Paperwhite is a fine little reader, and overall I'm happy I have it.",4

This version has finally taken all of the best elements of the previous Kindles and combined them into one unit. It is small and light, has both touch screen and button functionality (depending on which you prefer - I'm a fan of the buttons), and an excellent back-light. Kindle battery life has always been excellent, and is no different here. I use my Kindle daily, often for at least an hour at a time. The only downside is that I'm not sure what other features Amazon could add to improve this version, other than perhaps making it lighter weight. By far the best e-reader out there, and a worthy upgrade from a previous version",5

An extra bonus for me is, it fits in a pocket I wasn't using in my pannier I carry stuff to work everyday. I love the clarity of the text and pressure point page turning versus screen swipes.

3400,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,I never owned a Kindle before. This was easy to setup and get going.It also looks really good. The text is super easy to read even at smaller fonts. I also really like the buttons on the side that turn the pages because it is a lot easier to flip pages compared to tapping the screen.,5
3401,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,"Overall I've been very happy with my new Kindle Voyage, the screen is much sharper than my wife's paperwhite (v1) and the backlight is much more even. I've also been very happy with the page turn buttons. It makes it significantly more convenient to turn pages than using the screen and the pressure and feedback both seem about right. The only issue I have that keeps this from earning 5 stars is that the backlight on the screen has a slightly two-tone hue. It is somewhat yellowish on top and bluish on the bottom of the screen. It isn't something that really distracts from reading but it is noticeable when looking for it. Fix this so the coloring is even and it is really a perfect ereader.",4

With enabled dictionaries and X-ray I'm finally able to tackle books with a heavy character list like Game of Thrones. I'm serious, this is so convienent and user friendly.

Despite what one of Best Buys' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work.

I will likely sell it on Craig's List for less than half of what I paid for it.",1

Amazon offers tons of free apps, hundreds of thousands of free e-books and tons of free games. The tablet is intuitive and intelligent. I seamlessly enjoy streaming my favorite shows and reading articles, books and periodicals. What I love most is that the tablet doesn't place all apps on the device, but uses the users miro SD card instead for up to 200GB of additional storage for a dizzying amount of storage for more games, apps, books and movies that can be downloaded and enjoyed. It also allows the owner to share the device with family members, delegating each member an account personalized and tailored to that individual. There is even an option to create children's accounts--extra bonus. I am able to mirror the content from the tablet onto my Samsung Smart television. I will definitely consider Amazon first and foremost when making any future tablet purchases. It maintains a charge for a good deal of time, alleviating the need to be near an outlet to enjoy using it. I can charge it in the evening and use it for several hours the next day, sometimes two days. No one will ever create a tablet that is more considerate of the owner/end-user.",5

But they are expensive! Same thing with Android tablets. You can get a cheap Android tablet, but then you're left with a cheap tablet...poor quality displays, questionable hardware, limited support. I think Amazon hit the spot with their line of Fire Tablets - this HD8 in particular. It's good quality, has a great display, it's quick and snappy, has great battery life. Also being an Android based operating system, there is flexibility like accessing storage, side loading third party apps, even installing Google Play (for those who begrudge the lack of that feature, it can be done). Much more flexibility than you get with an Apple product, at a much lower price than the industry standard Samsung etc. Coming from using Apple products for so long, this thing is really convincing me that there are really viable options other than Apple, and especially for the price, its a great introduction to a different platform.

It fit my needs but I felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct.

3842,"All-New Fire HD 8 Tablet, 8"" HD Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta",Electronics,Great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet. It is very fast at everything accept game play. For example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable. The graphics struggle on this tablet with higher graphic games. Also it is a Amazon tablet with no Google play store but you can load Google play on to it. There are great you tube videos on how to put Google play on a amazon tablet. The screen is good as long as the sun isn't hitting it. The stereo speakers sound great and loud. All in all I really liked the tablet for the price but I really like to play games with good graphic quality. So that being said I did return this tablet and ordered the Nvidia Shield 8 inch tablet through Best Buy for 199 dollars. I got the Shield a week ago and WOW!! What a difference in graphic gaming quality. This thing is just as good as an Xbox1 or ps4. The Nvidia Shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the Apple or Samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost. Plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv. The Amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the Nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period!! I don't know why bbuy kind of hides the Nvidia tab only on their website and doesn't sell it in the store. If they displayed it in the store. This would outsell the Apple or Samsung tablets. I hope this helps thanks.,4

3858,"All-New Fire HD 8 Tablet, 8"" HD Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta",Electronics,"Purchased this as a child's tablet and I couldn't be happier! I was buying it thinking that it would be cut-rate but ok for a small child to play with on long car rides and on rainy days. Despite the low cost and unimpressive stats I have been very surprised by the quality. The screen is perfectly adequate for games and kids shows, the parental controls/child profile settings are excellent and the stereo speakers CRUSH the built in speakers on my iPad Air 2. The only drawbacks I have found so far are power related. The battery seems to drain fairly quickly under what I would consider normal use and the included charger (typical usb type) takes a very very long time to fully charge the tablet. I suspect this is the charger's limitation rather than the tablet's and it may charge better with a different power supply.I wish that I had purchased two of these tablets at the price they were for sale and I would have kept the second for my own use when on the road.",4

It's just the right balance between screen size and easy carrying. It also is great for Audible users (you will want to install a micro SD card, though). You can also use it to watch Netflix and the like, although I don't. As a tablet, it leaves a lot to be desired. If you are looking for a tablet, give this a pass. It has a lot of system lag, and Wifi reception is terrible even in areas where other devices show a strong signal!Also, you should know that you can't access any apps on the Google Play store; it's locked into Amazon. None of that bothers me because like I said, I only use it to read/listen to Kindle books, and this device works perfectly for that. Bottom line: if you just want a Kindle reading platform with some extra functionality, this will work well for you. If you're looking for the full Android tablet experience, look elsewhere.",4

4688,Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 4GB - Wi-Fi + 3G - Black,Electronics,This is a fantastic product for reading books. It is wonderful to use in full sunshine. I have a kindle fire so I thought this would be unnecessary now I am wishing I had purchased it sooner.

The auto-brightness works fine and is unnoticeable and it feels good in the hands. The new page squeeze feature is nice as is the haptic feedback when you squeeze the bezel.The power button is also much better placed now and the glass screen makes swiping and tapping the bookmark and location corner areas much easier. The backlight is now much more uniform than my 1st gen Paperwhite.The only issue I have is when displaying black blocks like the tree silhouette, I have what looks like a tiny bad pixel that kind of twinkles.

4770,"Kindle Oasis E-reader with Leather Charging Cover - Black, 6"" High-Resolution Display (300 ppi), Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers",Electronics,"Its a great ereader but a little pricy. It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor, which costs less. The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it's much lighter, it's brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you're using the cover. I've noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you'll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn't. But then I don't plan on reading when it's raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall, it's the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don't mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it! Voyage is still not a bad option though",5
4771,"Kindle Oasis E-reader with Leather Charging Cover - Black, 6"" High-Resolution Display (300 ppi), Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers",Electronics,"I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. They didn't include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don't think I'll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn't a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does. The only downside is that it doesn't work as a hands free stand for reading.(I still wish it was waterproof)",5

The Kindle Oasis is very tiny, portable & fits in about anything from a jeans back pockets to a very very small purse! The clarity of the screen is awesome. The touch of it works perfect! Very different than my HDX BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it! A little more pricey than the paperwhite BUT this one already comes with the case and a built in battery in the case so you are set for long time reading & the price is fair since the others you would still have to buy a case for it! Keep in mind the case for the oasis is leather and you can choose from black, brown and red (red was my choice., which to me it's not red it's more of a wine red color) it's beautiful!

Well done Best Buy! Having owned several previous Kindles, including the most recent Paperwhite model, I was unprepared for how small and light this new Oasis model is -- reading about it is one thing, but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely. The Oasis and its battery-charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest Paperwhite with no case. The Oasis _without_ its cover feels impossibly light at 4.6 ounces. Size-wise, the Oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5"" wide by 5.5"" tall. In fact, the shape is so different from traditional Kindle designs that I had to compare it next to my Paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size (they are). It's the first Kindle I think I could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort, For frequent travelers like me, this is a key reason to buy one of these, as it's extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse. The screen is the first front-lit Kindle I've ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the LEDs from any angle. No dark spots, no bright spots...just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions. The ""page"" also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface, helping achieve the illusion of printed paper. It's sharp and clear, better than any Kindle I've used. The reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart, since they are held together with magnets. After doing so, this is where the Amazon engineering team's achievements really become clear, as you just won't believe how lightweight this thing is. It's easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue, and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it 180 degrees when switching. The display instantly rotates, and the page turn buttons also ""follow"", with the top button always used to advance the page, and the bottom button always used to go backward. You can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models. The battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover's battery, so it runs down faster if you don't have it connected to the case. It's very easy to snap the reader back into its cover, which allows it to recharge while you continue to read. The power button and charge port are located in the upper top-right corner, more or less opposite from where they are on the Paperwhite. I find this location to be less awkward, as it's easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge. The back surface of the reader (not the case) seems to easily attract fingerprints, and they are not so easy to clean off. You'd think that Amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now. It's a minor annoyance. Lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model's high price relative to other Kindle models (without ads, it's $310 vs. $139 for an ad-less Paperwhite). Is this a lot of money? Perhaps, but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that's easy on both your arms and your eyes, then I personally think it's worth it. A lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit, and the price reflects that. Is it for everyone? Probably not, but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you'll have to wait to get one on Amazon's website. If you are a serious reader, this device deserves a very close look -- I'm definitely keeping mine!",5

4779,"Kindle Oasis E-reader with Leather Charging Cover - Black, 6"" High-Resolution Display (300 ppi), Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers",Electronics,I bought the Kindle Oasis for my wife as a 37th-anniversary gift. She enjoys reading and I thought that being able to adjust the text size would be very nice. She tried it for a few days and didn't care for it. She writes notes in the margins and wasn't happy with the way the Kindle did its notes. For just reading I think it would be a very nice product.,4

That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn‚Äôt heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I‚Äôm on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I‚Äôm sitting down. No matter what I‚Äôm doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won‚Äôt allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its ‚Äúdual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.‚Äù This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don‚Äôt occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don‚Äôt limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I‚Äôm done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don‚Äôt plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn‚Äôt needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren‚Äôt a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won‚Äôt appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn‚Äôt last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have.",5
4782,"Kindle Oasis E-reader with Leather Charging Cover - Black, 6"" High-Resolution Display (300 ppi), Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers",Electronics,"With the cover attached, the battery lasts for a good, long period. With the cover detached (which is how I use it primarily), the Oasis is so thin that it is almost weightless in your hand. The ability to switch hands (flip upside down) means one never seems to tire of holding the device to read a book; and, it fits into my pants pocket, again, perfect for traveling. The battery seems to last with heavy usage for at least several days, but I tend to reconnect the cover at night (I am assuming that helps to recharge the basic Oasis battery). Regardless, it was well worth replacing our older Kindle readers with the newer Oasis (we bought two).",5

I use it mostly to read with an occasional game or movie too. Colors are great and the size of the screen is very nice. I have a 7 inch fire and there is enough size difference for movies etc to make it worthwhile. Plus there was a great black Friday price.,5
4870,"All-New Fire HD 8 Tablet, 8"" HD Display, Wi-Fi, 32 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta",Electronics,"For the price this is an excellent tablet. I have a high end laptop that does convert to tablet but at almost 16"" and the foldover design I normally just use it in laptop mode. I also have a high end ""phablet"" sized phone. So I was not sure how often I'd use a tablet, and did not want to spend 500ish on an ipad. The Fire has been a great ""in between"" so far on days I use my phone alot and want to avoid charging more than once per day, and don't have the need to use my laptop. The speed is zippy & the screen clarity/quality is good enough. Storage is even better than ipads since it is expandable (for now I use a 64 gb card giving me a total of 96 gb, but the expandable can go up to 200 gb). Tying into Amazon is nice since I have Amazon Prime). Basic web surfing, email & facebook work great. The only ""bad"" feature is the camera & video quality. But that does not matter to me since I have my high quality camera & video recorder on my phone. Only other slight negative is light bleed noticed just when booting up on grey screen. Color/brightness uniformity is perfect to my eyes once it is up & running. Really enjoying the kindle component for book & magazine reading as well. Overall, probably the best $100 I have spent in a long time.",5
4871,"All-New Fire HD 8 Tablet, 8"" HD Display, Wi-Fi, 32 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta",Electronics,"I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of ""back"" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the ""X"" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of ""new items."" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under ""new items"" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the ""home"" menu. It's the ""recent"" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's ""On Deck"" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the ""on deck"" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you.",4

It uses their version of the Android OS which they call the Fire OS which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use - Be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the Google Play store, but must rely on Amazon's own app store which is decent, but not as extensive as either Apple's or Google's.",4
